Recipe: Trail Mix Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 13 ingredients, 18 steps

Ingredients needed:
1½ cups assorted raw nuts and seeds, ½ cup (60 g) old-fashioned oats, 1 large egg, 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. (25 g) granulated sugar, 1½ tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ½ tsp. baking soda, ¾ cup assorted dried fruit (cut into ½" pieces if large), ¾ cup chopped bittersweetchocolate bars or chips or disks, ½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour, Flaky sea salt

Cooking instructions:
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast nuts and seeds and oats on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool. Meanwhile, mix egg, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; let sit until nuts are cool (this will make for a chewier cookie). Add dried fruit and chocolate to nut mixture; toss to combine. Give egg mixture a good stir, then stir in flour. Mix in nut mixture, smashing it against the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until combined and mix-ins are evenly coated in dough. (It will look like too many mix-ins, but dough will come together as it chills.) Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Reheat oven to 350°F. Using a ⅓-cup measure or #16 cookie scoop, portion out dough, packing firmly, to make 12 cookies. Divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets as you go. Using measuring cup or your hand, press cookies into 2½"-diameter disks about ¾" thick; sprinkle with sea salt. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back once, until golden brown and no longer wet-looking, 11–13 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Do Ahead: Cookies can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Sour Cream and Onion Biscuits
Category: cookies
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 20 steps

Ingredients needed:
2½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, 1¾ tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, 1¼ tsp. sugar, 2½ cups (313 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface, 10 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into (½") pieces, plus 2 Tbsp. melted, 8 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise (not on a diagonal), 1¼ cups sour cream, plus more for serving, Flaky sea salt

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 425°F. Whisk salt, pepper, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and 2½ cups flour in a large bowl to combine. Add chilled butter and toss to coat. Using your hands, work butter into dry ingredients until there are lots of flat pieces and pea-size bits. Add scallions and toss to evenly distribute. Create a well in the center of mixture and add 1¼ cups sour cream into the center. Using a fork and working in circles, mix until large shaggy clumps form. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead once or twice until it comes together (flour your hands if needed). If there are any loose bits, add them to center of dough and knead once more to incorporate. Pat dough into an 8x4" rectangle about 1" thick. Working from a short side, fold dough in thirds as you would a letter. It doesn’t need to overlap perfectly. Pat dough into another 8x4" rectangle, then fold dough in thirds like a letter one more time. Pat dough back into an 8x4" rectangle and cut in half lengthwise. Cut each half crosswise into 4 squares for a total of 8 biscuits. Transfer biscuits to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Brush tops gently with melted butter; sprinkle with sea salt. Bake biscuits until golden brown, 18–22 minutes. Serve warm with sour cream (or more butter!) for slathering.

Recipe: Salty Buckwheat Chocolate Chunk Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 28 steps

Ingredients needed:
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 equal pieces, 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, ½ cup (63 g) buckwheat flour, ½ tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt; plus more (optional), ⅔ cup (packed; 133 g) light brown sugar, ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar, 1 large egg, 2 large egg yolks, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate (65% - 75% cacao) bars or wafers (disks, pistoles, fèves), coarsely chopped

Cooking instructions:
Heat butter in a small saucepan over the lowest heat possible until melted (you don’t want it to sputter or brown), about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl. Scrape butter into a large bowl and add brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until butter is absorbed into sugar, about 30 seconds. Add egg, then egg yolks, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition; whisk in vanilla. Mixture should look much lighter in color and be almost creamy. Add dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir until just incorporated and almost no dry streaks remain. Set aside a handful of chocolate, then add remaining chocolate to batter. Gently mix just to evenly distribute. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel (a silicone lid or plastic wrap also works) and chill 2 hours. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a tablespoon, scoop out 2-Tbsp. portions of dough (or, if you have one, this is a leveled-off #30 cookie scoop or a heaping #40) and place 5 on each baking sheet, spacing evenly. Roll into balls and gently press 2–3 pieces of reserved chocolate onto the top of each one. It’s okay to jam the chocolate on there—some pieces can even be vertical. Cover and chill any remaining dough. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are golden brown and centers are puffed, 8–10 minutes. Working one at a time, pull baking sheets out of the oven and tap lightly on the stove to deflate cookies. Sprinkle with Diamond Crystal kosher salt (if you’re using Morton, skip it: the crystals are too large). Let cookies cool on baking sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely. Let baking sheets cool, then turn parchment paper over. Repeat process with remaining dough, dividing evenly between baking sheets, to make 6–8 more cookies. Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Let cool; store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Tie-Dye Butter Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 39 steps

Ingredients needed:
14 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar, 1¼ tsp. kosher salt, 2 large egg yolks, 2 tsp. vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste, 2 cups (256 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, Special Equipment: Assorted (2") cookie cutters, 2 cups (240 g) powdered sugar, divided, 6 Tbsp. (or more) whole milk, divided, 2 tsp. (or more) any color plant-based food-coloring powder, 2 tsp. (or more) second color plant-based food-coloring powder, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, divided

Cooking instructions:
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add 2 cups flour, and mix until incorporated. Dough will be semifirm but can be rolled out without chilling. If your kitchen is very warm and/or dough is sticky, pat it into a 1"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill 15 minutes to let firm up before rolling out. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to keep dough from sticking, to about ¼" thick. Punch out shapes as desired with lightly floured cookie cutters and transfer to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1½" apart. Pat scraps into a 1"-thick disk, wrap with plastic, and chill 10 minutes if soft. Bake 1 sheet of cookies, rotating halfway through, until edges are golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Let cookies cool 10 minutes on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Bake remaining sheet of cookies, then repeat process with remaining dough. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead; wrap tightly and freeze. Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Whisk 1 cup powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. milk, 2 tsp. food-coloring powder, and half of salt in a small bowl until no lumps remain. Glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; add more milk if needed. For a deeper color, whisk in more powder 1 tsp. at a time until desired color is achieved; adjust with milk if needed. Repeat with second food-coloring powder, remaining salt, remaining 1 cup powdered sugar, and remaining 3 Tbsp. milk, adjusting intensity of color as desired. Spoon 1 tsp. first glaze in the center of a small plate. Drizzle 1 tsp. second glaze over the first and use a toothpick to slightly swirl colors together; don’t go overboard. (If you want to decorate larger cookies, add 1 tsp. glaze to plate for each additional inch.) Gently press the top of a cookie into glaze, then lift up and allow excess glaze to drip back onto the plate. Using a toothpick, pop any air bubbles and swirl colors more if desired. Transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with 2 more cookies, adding ½ tsp. of each color of glaze to plate before each cookie is dipped. The glaze will lose its swirly effect at this point. Clean plate and repeat process, decorating cookies in batches of 3 until all cookies have been glazed. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours. Do Ahead: Cookies can be glazed 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped on a rimmed baking sheet at room temperature.

Recipe: Ancho Mole Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 15 ingredients, 34 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup (140 g) nuts (such as blanched hazelnuts, blanched almonds, or walnuts), 1¼ cups (185 g; or more) raw sesame seeds, divided, ⅓ cup (54 g) ancho powder (pure ground ancho chiles, not ancho chile powder, which has added salt, cumin, and other spices), ¼ cup agave syrup, preferably dark, 2 cups (256 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp. baking powder, ¼ tsp. ground cinnamon, 12 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, ½ cup (100 g) sugar, 1¾ tsp. kosher salt, 3 large egg yolks, 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste, ¾ cup (130 g) dried fruit (such as papaya, mango, or pineapple), cut into (¾") pieces, ¾ cup (110 g) bittersweet chocolate wafers (disks, pistoles, fèves; preferably 72% cacao), 1 large egg white, lightly beaten

Cooking instructions:
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast nuts and ¼ cup sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet on upper rack, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool. Stir together ancho powder and agave syrup in a small bowl. Whisk flour, baking powder, and cinnamon in a medium bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, sugar, and salt in a large bowl, scraping down sides and bottom of bowl as needed, until light and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add egg yolks and vanilla and beat until incorporated, about 1 minute. Scrape in ancho mixture and beat until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients, and beat to combine. Add dried fruit, chocolate, and toasted nuts and sesame seeds; mix with a wooden spoon until evenly distributed. Divide dough in half. Working one at a time, roll each piece into a 10"-long log. Wrap each log tightly in plastic and roll across work surface to make as smooth and cylindrical as possible. Place on a rimmed baking sheet and freeze until surface is firm, about 20 minutes. Slap a log down onto counter to create a flat side; roll over and slap again to flatten another side (you’re aiming for a triangular shape). Repeat to create third side of the triangle. Tap against counter to smooth if needed, then tap ends to flatten. Repeat with second log. Return logs to baking sheet; freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Working one at a time, unwrap logs and brush sides with egg white. Working on baking sheet, sprinkle sides with remaining 1 cup sesame seeds and gently press to coat. Surface should be covered; use more sesame if needed. Freeze logs on baking sheet, uncovered, until surface is very firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350°F. Slice a log crosswise into ¼"-thick triangles and divide cookies between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1" apart. (If dough is soft or starts to lose its shape, freeze 10 minutes before continuing.) Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are just set, about 10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Transfer cookies to a platter or airtight container and line baking sheets with fresh sheets of parchment paper. Repeat process with remaining dough. Do Ahead: Dough can be rolled into logs 3 days ahead; refrigerate. Transfer to freezer 30 minutes before slicing. Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Butter Pecan Skillet Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 34 steps

Ingredients needed:
1⅓ cups (160 g) chopped pecans, 4 Tbsp. pure maple syrup, 2 tsp. kosher salt, divided, 10 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus more for pan, 1¼ cups (160 g) all-purpose flour, 6 Tbsp. (packed; 75 g) light brown sugar, 1 large egg, 1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste, 1 cup (120 g) powdered sugar, 3 Tbsp. (or more) whole milk, Coarse white sanding sugar and edible glitter (for decorating)

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toss pecans, maple syrup, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Scrape onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and spread nuts into a single layer. Bake until pecans are slightly darkened and syrup is dark and bubbling, 15–20 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully toss pecans in hot syrup to coat again. Let cool on baking sheet until caramel hardens, about 30 minutes. Break up candied pecans into pieces; discard any burned bits. Reduce oven temperature to 325°F. Generously butter a 10" cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet; line bottom with a round of parchment paper and butter parchment. Pulse flour, brown sugar, half of candied pecans, and 1¼ tsp. salt in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add egg, 1 Tbsp. vanilla, and remaining 10 Tbsp. butter and process until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer dough to a large bowl and knead a couple of times just to bring it together. Using damp hands, pat dough evenly into skillet, extending all the way to the sides of the pan. Bake cookie until edges are golden brown and center is slightly puffed, 30–35 minutes. Let cool in skillet 1 hour. Invert cookie onto a cutting board and cut into 16 wedges. Turn right side up and transfer to a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Whisk powdered sugar, milk, remaining ¼ tsp. salt, and remaining 1 tsp. vanilla in a small wide bowl until smooth. The glaze should be the consistency of heavy cream; thin with more milk if needed. Transfer half of the glaze to another small wide bowl (you’ll need to use 2 bowls as the glaze will start to collect crumbs and you’ll want a fresh start). Working one at a time, lightly dip half of the wedges, top side down, into first bowl of glaze so that only the surface is covered and no glaze drips down the sides. Use a toothpick to pop any bubbles and smooth glaze; coating should be thin enough to see the cookie peeking through. Repeat with remaining wedges and second bowl of glaze. Top wedges with remaining candied pecans and let sit 10 minutes. Sprinkle with sanding sugar and glitter and let sit until glaze is set, about 1 hour. Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Sourdough Biscuits
Category: cookies
Complexity: 8 ingredients, 21 steps

Ingredients needed:
1½ tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ½ tsp. sugar, 1½ cups (188 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, ½ cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter or vegan butter (preferably Miyoko’s), cut into small pieces, plus 2 Tbsp. melted for brushing, 1 cup (270 g) sourdough starter discard from a starter fed within the previous 24 hours, room temperature, Flaky sea salt (optional)

Cooking instructions:
Preheat oven to 425°. Stir together baking powder, baking soda, kosher salt, sugar, and 1½ cups flour with a fork in a large bowl. Add ½ cup chilled butter and toss with your hands or fork just to coat. Using your fingers, smash butter into flat disks (if you miss a few, it will be fine). Using a pastry cutter or fork, work butter into dry ingredients until shaggy crumbles form (you should have some large pieces, some small pieces, some flat pieces, and some sandy flour). Add sourdough starter and mix gently with fork to incorporate, then fold with your hands just until dough comes together with just a few crumbly pieces in the bottom of the bowl. Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and pat out with your hands until about ½” thick (the shape doesn’t matter too much at this point). Fold into thirds as you would a letter to create a rough rectangle. Working from short sides, fold in thirds like a letter again. Pat dough out to a ½”-thick square. Repeat folding process. Pat out dough for a third time to a 1”-thick square—it should feel airy, like a pillow at this point. Using a floured 2½”-diameter biscuit cutter or glass, punch out as many biscuits as you can (do not twist cutter). Transfer biscuits to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, spacing at least 1” apart. Using your hands, gently press scraps into a rectangle, then fold in half. Pat out to a 1”-thick rectangle and cut out more biscuits. Gather remaining scraps together to form 1 final biscuit (you should have 10 total). Transfer to baking sheet. Brush biscuit tops with 2 Tbsp. melted butter and sprinkle with sea salt if desired Bake biscuits until tall and golden and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the side of a biscuit registers 205°F), 12–15 minutes.

Recipe: Sourdough Key Lime Ricotta Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 25 steps

Ingredients needed:
8 tbsp (113 g) unsalted butter, softened, 1 cup (200 g) sugar, 1 large egg, 1⁄2 cup (120 g) leftover starter, 1 cup (125 g) whole milk ricotta, Zest of 1 lime or several key limes, 1 tsp (5 ml) pure vanilla extract, 3 cups (360 g) all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp (15 g) baking powder, 1⁄2 tsp fine sea salt, 3⁄4 cup (90 g) powdered sugar, sifted, Juice of 1 to 2 limes, zest reserved for decoration

Cooking instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Line two sheet pans with parchment paper and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the egg and mix to combine. With the machine running, add the leftover starter, ricotta, lime zest, and vanilla. Depending on the temperature of your ingredients, the mixture may become lumpy—this is okay. Meanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. On low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients and mix until just incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once more, making sure that there is no flour hiding at the bottom. It will smell wonderful. Cover the bowl in plastic wrap and chill the dough for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Then portion the dough onto your sheet pans using a tablespoon or mini ice cream scoop. Place both sheet pans into the oven and bake for about 15 to 17 minutes. Rotate the pans and swap racks at the halfway mark for even coloring. When finished, the cookies will be pale yellow with golden bottoms and will feel soft to the touch. Transfer to a wire rack. For the glaze, sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl. Add the juice of 1 lime and whisk until a smooth glaze forms. If the texture is too thick, add more lime juice as needed until you achieve a pourable consistency. Once the cookies are completely cool, drizzle some of the glaze over the top. Finish with grated lime zest to decorate. These cookies will stay fresh for up to 3 to 5 days stored in an airtight container. Alternatively, freeze for up to 2 months by placing unglazed cookies between sheets of parchment paper to prevent sticking.

Recipe: Double Chocolate Rye Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 22 steps

Ingredients needed:
¾ cup (90 grams) walnut halves, 9 ounces (255 gram) bittersweet chocolate, 6 ounces (170 grams) unsweetened chocolate, ½ cup or 1 stick (115 grams) unsalted butter, ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1 ½ cups (300 grams) sugar, 4 large eggs (about 200 grams), at room temperature, ½ cup (60 grams) rye flour, ½ teaspoon baking powder, ½ teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Place the walnuts on a baking sheet and toast for 8 to 10 minutes, until they start to smell fragrant and are lightly golden brown when you break one in half. Remove them from the oven and let cool. Roughly chop them and set aside. Chop 5 ounces of the bittersweet chocolate and 4 ounces of the unsweetened chocolate into large chunks and place them with the butter in a metal or heatproof glass bowl. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water and heat, stirring occasionally, until completely smooth. Remove from the heat, whisk in the vanilla, and let cool for about 20 minutes so it’s not piping hot. In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whisk together the sugar and eggs for about 5 minutes on medium-high speed, until light and thick and pale yellow. With the mixer on low, slowly add the chocolate-butter mixture and whisk for about 15 seconds. It will not be completely mixed at this point but that’s okay, because you will finish combining all the ingredients by hand. Chop the remaining 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate into 1-inch chunks and shave the remaining 2 ounces unsweetened chocolate into fine shavings. In a medium bowl, stir together the rye flour, the chopped bittersweet chocolate, shaved unsweetened chocolate, baking powder, salt, and toasted walnuts. Remove the bowl from the mixer, add the rye flour mixture, and fold it in by hand until the dough is completely homogeneous. For best results, scrape the dough into an airtight container and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 hours or up to overnight before baking. (The unbaked dough can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.) Preheat the oven to 350°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Drop the dough in ¼-cup scoops onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, rotating the baking sheet midway through the baking time, until the cookies are just starting to crack on the edges and the centers are soft but not liquidy when you press them. Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer them to the rack and let cool completely. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

Recipe: Black-and-White-and-Green Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 13 ingredients, 34 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 tsp. baking powder, 2½ cups (320 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 1½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more, 2 cups (packed; 45 g) mint leaves, 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, 1¼ cups (2½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, 1 large egg, 1 large egg yolk, Coarse sanding sugar or Swedish pearl sugar (for decorating), 1 cup (120 g) powdered sugar, 2 Tbsp. (20 g) Dutch-process or unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 Tbsp. light corn syrup, Special Equipment: A 3"-diameter cookie cutter

Cooking instructions:
Whisk baking powder, 2½ cups flour, and 1½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine. Pulse mint and granulated sugar in a food processor until mint is finely chopped. Add butter; process to combine. Add dry ingredients and pulse again to combine. Add egg and egg yolk; pulse until a shaggy dough forms. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead just until dough holds its shape. Divide dough in half; pat each portion into a 1"-thick disk. Wrap disks in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Working with 1 disk at a time, roll out dough on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper to about ¼" thick, dusting with more flour as needed to keep from sticking. Punch out rounds with lightly floured cookie cutter and arrange on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 1" apart. Pat dough scraps into a 1"-thick disk. Wrap in plastic and chill 10 minutes if soft. Repeat process with scraps. Hold a bench scraper or straightedge upright 1" from edge of a cookie to cordon off a shallow semicircle (do not press down into dough; you’re just making a barrier). Coat semicircle with sanding sugar; gently press to adhere. Remove scraper; you should have a tidy sugared edge. Repeat with remaining cookies and more sanding sugar. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until edges are lightly browned, 10–12 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to 2 wire racks set inside 2 rimmed baking sheets; let cool completely. Sift powdered sugar and cocoa powder into a medium bowl. Add corn syrup, a pinch of salt, and 2 Tbsp. warm water and stir until smooth and glossy. Position bench scraper to make another shallow semicircle on the other side of the cookie, angling it so that it forms a V with the sugared edge, lightly pressing scraper into cookie to make a barrier. Spoon 1 tsp. glaze onto exposed semicircle and use a toothpick to help coat evenly; excess will drip over sides. Lift scraper straight up and over chocolate side to create a neat edge. Repeat with remaining cookies and glaze. Let sit until glaze is set, at least 2 hours. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead; freeze. Thaw in refrigerator before using. Cookies can be baked 1 day ahead; store tightly wrapped on a rimmed baking sheet at room temperature.

Recipe: Goat Butter Shortbread
Category: cookies
Complexity: 7 ingredients, 40 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup (8 ounces) cold goat butter, cubed, ½ cup granulated sugar, ¼ cup toasted wheat germ, 1 ¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour, ¼ cup whole wheat flour, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, ½ teaspoon sea salt flakes

Cooking instructions:
Put the butter and sugar into the bowl of a stand mixer and refrigerate until the butter is firm, approximately 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350°F and spread the wheat germ onto a half sheet (13 by 18-inch) pan. Toast until slightly aromatic, approximately 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature. In a bowl, whisk together the flours, salts, and toasted wheat germ. Remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Fit the mixer with the paddle attachment. Add the flour mixture to the butter and sugar and mix on low speed until the dough starts to resemble a coarse meal, 6 to 8 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix until the dough just starts to clump around the paddle or to the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer. With a plastic bench scraper, bring the dough completely together by hand. Place the dough on a surface lightly dusted with flour. Roll the dough back and forth into a cylinder. Using your fingers, pat the dough into a rectangle. Put a sheet of parchment paper the same dimensions as a half sheet pan on the work surface and dust lightly with flour. Put the dough on top. Using a rolling pin, begin rolling out the dough. If any cracks form in the dough, stop to push them together. To keep the dough from sticking to the parchment paper, dust the top lightly with flour, cover with another piece of parchment paper, and, sandwiching the dough between both sheets of parchment paper, flip the dough and paper over. Peel off the top layer of parchment paper and continue to roll. Roll the dough into a 10 by 12- or 14-inch rectangle approximately ¼ inch thick. If the surface is uneven, roll a pastry roller across the surface to even it out. Ease the dough and parchment paper onto a half sheet pan. Cover with another piece of parchment paper and refrigerate until firm, at least 20 minutes. Heat the oven to 350°F. Line a couple of half sheet pans with parchment paper. Let the dough sit at room temperature for up to 10 minutes. Invert the dough onto a work surface and peel off the top sheet of parchment paper. Roll a dough docker over the dough or pierce it numerous times with a fork. Using a 1 ¾ by 2 ½-inch (or comparable) cookie cutter, cut out the shortbread. Reroll the dough trimmings, chill, and cut out more cookies. If you don’t have a comparable cookie cutter, you can cut out the rectangles with a knife. Evenly space 12 to 16 shortbreads on the prepared pan. Place the pan in the oven, lower the temperature to 325°F, and bake for 10 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake until the cookies feel firm to the touch and are slightly brown around the edges, 6 to 8 minutes more. Let the cookies cool entirely on the sheet pan. Repeat with the remaining dough. The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. Dough can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.

Recipe: Sumac and Vanilla Shortbread
Category: cookies
Complexity: 7 ingredients, 12 steps

Ingredients needed:
240g (8 ½ oz) butter, at room temperature, 120g (4 1⁄4 oz/1 cup) confectioners' sugar, 360g (12 ¾ oz/2 ¾ cups) all-purpose flour, 1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped out, ½ tsp flaky sea salt, 2 tbsp sumac, 2 tbsp granulated sugar

Cooking instructions:
Use a food processor or an electric mixer with a paddle attachment to work the butter, icing sugar, flour, vanilla seeds and salt until the mixture just forms a ball of dough. It takes a while to come together, so don’t lose faith. Once it has formed, turn the dough out onto the work surface. Divide into two pieces and shape each one into a log – I prefer to make it rectangular but it is tasty in any shape. Mix the sumac and sugar on the work surface. Roll the log in the sumac-sugar to coat all over, then place in the fridge to set for at least 1 hour (or freeze it until you want to bake them). Heat your oven to 190°C/170°C fan/375°F/gas mark 5. Line two baking trays with baking paper. Use a sharp knife to cut each log into 12–14 slices and place them flat on the trays. Bake for 10–12 minutes until light golden, then remove from the oven. Leave to cool on the tray before eating.

Recipe: Pastel Butter Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 8 ingredients, 15 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup whole blanched almonds, toasted, 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, ½ teaspoon coarse salt, ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature, 1 cup confectioners’ sugar, sifted, plus 1/2 cup per tinted sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, Freeze-dried fruits in various colors, such as blueberries, raspberries, and mangoes

Cooking instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Place toasted almonds in the bowl of a food processor. Add flour, salt, and cinnamon, and process until nuts are finely ground, about 1 minute. In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer on medium, beat butter and 1 cup confectioners’ sugar until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add vanilla and beat until combined. With mixer on low, gradually add almond mixture and beat until just incorporated. Using a 1 1/2‑inch (1‑tablespoon) cookie scoop, drop dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until edges are just golden, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer sheets to wire racks and let cool completely. For each desired color, place 1/2 cup fruit with 1/2 cup confectioners’ sugar in the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth and evenly tinted. (Sugars can be stored in airtight containers up to 1 month.) Place tinted sugars in small bowls and dip cookies, domed-side down, into tinted sugars to coat. Transfer to a plate and let rest, about 30 minutes. (Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.)

Recipe: Chocolate-Hazelnut Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 15 ingredients, 24 steps

Ingredients needed:
¾ cup (115 g) blanched hazelnuts, 3½ cups (440 g) all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ¾ tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, ½ tsp. ground ginger, 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar, ½ cup (100 g) raw sugar or granulated sugar, ½ cup (100 g) (packed) light brown sugar, 2 large eggs, room temperature, ¼ cup honey, ½ tsp. vanilla extract, 4 (2-oz.) bittersweet chocolate bars, cut lengthwise into ¼"-thick sticks, Flaky sea salt

Cooking instructions:
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 300°F. Toast hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet on upper rack, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool slightly, then chop very coarsely; set aside. Increase oven temperature to 350°F. Whisk flour, kosher salt, baking powder, baking soda, and ginger in a large bowl to combine. Beat butter, granulated sugar, raw sugar, and brown sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high speed, scraping down sides of bowl occasionally, until pale and fluffy, 5–7 minutes. Reduce speed to medium-high and add eggs, one at a time, increasing speed to high after each addition to fully incorporate and stopping periodically to scrape down sides of bowl. Add honey and vanilla and beat just to combine. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients; beat until combined. Add chocolate and reserved nuts and beat just until incorporated. Scoop dough into 1½-oz. portions (about 3 Tbsp.); roll into balls (if the batter feels loose or sticky, chill 30 minutes). Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Chill until firm, at least 2 hours. Arrange chilled cookies on 2 fresh parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2" apart; you should be able to fit about 12 cookies on each. Sprinkle cookies with sea salt. Bake, rotating top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until bottoms and edges are golden brown, 12–15 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Place a fresh sheet of parchment on 1 baking sheet and repeat process with remaining balls of dough. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 1 month ahead. Transfer chilled balls to resealable freezer bags and freeze. Bake from frozen.

Recipe: Whole Grain Shortbread with Einkorn and Rye Flour
Category: cookies
Complexity: 8 ingredients, 30 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup, plus 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, very soft, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 cup, plus 1 Tbsp. einkorn flour, 3/4 cup, plus 1 Tbsp. rye Flour, 1/3 cup rice flour, 5 Tbsp. cornstarch, 1/3 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup Superfine or granulated sugar, for topping

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Butter a 6 by 10 in. baking dish. Place the butter in a mixing bowl. The butter must be very soft—the consistency of mayonnaise or whipped cream. Add the salt to the butter and mix well. Sift the flours and cornstarch together into another bowl. Add the granulated sugar to the butter and mix just until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix just until a smooth dough forms. Pat the dough evenly into the prepared baking dish. The dough should be no more than 2/3 in. deep. Bake until the top and bottom are lightly browned, about 30 minutes. The middle of the shortbread should remain light. Let cool on a wire rack until warm to the touch. Sprinkle the shortbread with the superfine sugar. Tilt the dish so that the sugar fully and evenly coats the surface and then tip out the excess sugar. With a very thin, sharp knife, cut the shortbread into rectangular fingers about 1/2 in. wide and 2 in. long. If the cookies have become cold they will not slice well, so they must still be warm to the touch at this point. Chill thoroughly before removing from the baking dish. The first cookie is difficult to remove, but the rest should come out easily with the aid of a small, thin offset spatula. The cookies will keep in an airtight container in a cool place for up to 2 weeks. Skip sprinkling the shortbread with sugar. Temper 8 oz. milk, dark, or white chocolate. Dip half of the cookie in the melted chocolate, letting excess chocolate drip back into the bowl, and let set. Alternatively, you can use melted, untempered chocolate, but refrigerate the cookies after dipping to set the chocolate.

Recipe: Salty-Sweet Fall Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 9 ingredients, 18 steps

Ingredients needed:
4 1/2 cups all-purpose ﬂour, plus more for rolling, 1 Tbsp baking powder, 1 1/2 cups salted butter, at room temperature, 1 1/2 cups white granulated sugar, 3 large eggs, 1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cups chopped chocolate-covered pretzels, Milk chocolate candy melts, 1 1/2-inch square cookie cutter

Cooking instructions:
Whisk the ﬂour and baking powder together in a medium bowl. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer ﬁtted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until smooth or about 2 1/2 minutes. Beat in the eggs and vanilla until ﬂuffy, about 1 minute. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Turn the mixer speed to low and add the ﬂour mixture approximately a quarter at a time, scraping the sides of the bowl after each addition. Reserve 1/4 cup of the chocolate-covered pretzels. Mix the remaining pretzels into the cookie dough until fully incorporated. The dough will form a ball around the paddle attachment and feel soft but not sticky. Wrap the dough ball in a piece of plastic wrap and press down to form a 1-inch thick disk. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes, or store for up to 7 days tightly wrapped. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Roll out the dough on a lightly ﬂoured ﬂat work surface to about 1/4-inch thickness, using additional ﬂour as necessary to prevent sticking. Use cookie cutters to create the shapes you want, and carefully transfer with a metal spatula to a nonstick baking sheet, placing the cookies about 3/4 inch apart. Bake one sheet at a time on the middle rack about 7 to 8 minutes, until puffy. Let the cookies rest for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Melt the candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl on 30 percent power for 30-second increments until melted. Using a honey dipper, drizzle the chocolate over the cookies and sprinkle with the reserved chocolate-covered pretzels.

Recipe: Cherry Biscuit Cobbler
Category: cookies
Complexity: 19 ingredients, 29 steps

Ingredients needed:
1/4 cup granulated sugar, 1 Tbsp. baking powder, 2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface, 1/2 cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 1/3 cups chilled heavy cream, 2 lb. fresh (or frozen) sweet cherries, pitted, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 3 Tbsp. cornstarch, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/4 tsp. almond extract, 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, 2 Tbsp. raw sugar, Vanilla ice cream or softly whipped cream (for serving), A 1 1/2"-diameter cookie cutter

Cooking instructions:
Whisk granulated sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, salt, and 2 cups flour in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Quickly smash butter into flour mixture with your fingers, working until the largest pieces are about the size of a pea. Gradually stream cream into bowl, tossing flour mixture constantly with a fork to distribute. Using a flexible bench scraper or a hard plastic spatula, fold dough over and onto itself several times, scraping bottom and sides of the bowl, to bring together into a mass (dough will feel very wet and sticky). Turn out dough onto a generously floured surface. Pat into a 3/4"-thick rectangle or square with floured hands, using bench scraper or spatula to lift up dough and dust underneath with more flour as needed to prevent sticking. Dust surface with more flour, then cut dough into 4 equal pieces and stack on top of each other. Dust with flour and press down on stack with a rolling pin to flatten to a workable height. Roll out to 1/2" thick, dusting with more flour as needed. Use cutter to punch out biscuits as closely as possible, dipping cutter in flour often. Transfer biscuits to a plate. You should have about 40. Gather up dough scraps, reroll, and punch out more biscuits if needed. Chill until ready to use. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 1 day ahead; wrap tightly and chill. Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 400°F. Mix cherries, granulated sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, cinnamon, vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt in a large bowl. Scrape filling into a 2-qt. baking dish or 9"-diameter cake pan with 2" sides and press down on it firmly to compact. Place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Arrange chilled biscuits over filling, fitting snugly so they’re touching with only a few gaps. Brush generously with butter; sprinkle with raw sugar. Bake cobbler 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue to bake until biscuits are golden brown and juices are bubbling, 50–65 minutes more. Let cool slightly. Serve cobbler with ice cream. Do Ahead: Cobbler can be baked 1 day ahead; store tightly covered at room temperature.

Recipe: Black Bottom Brownie Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 13 ingredients, 31 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. (225 g) sugar, 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp. (80 g) unsweetened cocoa powder, 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, 3/4 tsp. kosher salt, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 2 cold large eggs, 1/2 cup (65 g) all-purpose flour, 3 Tbsp. (42 g) sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. (6 g) cornstarch, 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, 4 oz. cream cheese, room temperature, 1 1/4 oz. chopped bittersweet chocolate (about 1/4 cup), Flaky sea salt

Cooking instructions:
Heat sugar, cocoa, butter, and kosher salt in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring occasionally, until butter is melted and mixture is hot enough that you want to remove your finger fairly quickly after dipping it in to test, about 15 minutes. (Don’t worry if it looks gritty.) Let cool until mixture is warm, not hot, about 5 minutes. Stir in vanilla with a wooden spoon. Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously after each addition, until mixture looks thick and glossy. Add flour and mix until combined, then beat vigorously with wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until shiny and homogenous, about 1 minute. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and freeze at least 8 hours or up to overnight. Whisk sugar, cornstarch, and kosher salt to combine in a small bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese in a large bowl until smooth. Add sugar mixture and continue to beat until well combined. Fold in chocolate. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and freeze until very firm, at least 8 hours or up to overnight. Place racks in top and bottom thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats. Let dough sit at room temperature 5–10 minutes. Using a spoon dipped in hot water, scoop 20 balls of dough (about 1 1/2 Tbsp. each) and roll into smooth balls with your hands. Using your thumb, make an imprint in center of ball, then fill each indent with about 1 tsp. cream cheese filling. Using your fingers, flatten edges of dough to about a 3" circle with the filling in the middle (like you’re making a dumpling). Fold dough over filling to cover completely; pinch to seal. Arrange on prepared sheets, spacing at least 3" apart. For best results, freeze dough 10 minutes. Bake cookies, rotating pans halfway through, until edges are set and firm (the centers may be a little shiny and wet-looking), 12–14 minutes. Sprinkle cookies with sea salt while still warm, then let cool on baking sheets until firm. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 2 days ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill. Assembled unbaked cookies can be made 2 months ahead. Freeze on baking sheets, then transfer to freezer bags and keep frozen.

Beat granulated sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat to incorporate, about 1 minute. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients. Beat just until dough comes together. Divide in half and pat each into a disk; wrap tightly in plastic. Chill just long enough that dough is rollable and no longer sticky, about 30 minutes. Working one at a time, roll out dough between 2 sheets of parchment paper until 1/8" thick. Slide onto baking sheets, still sandwiched between parchment, and chill until very firm, about 1 hour. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Carefully peel away top sheets of parchment from dough and punch out cookies with larger cutters. Punch out centers of half of cookies with smaller cutters. Carefully transfer whole cookies with a spatula to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1" apart. Sprinkle remaining cut-out cookies with sanding sugar, then transfer to another parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake cookies until edges are set, 7–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Repeat process with scraps (chill dough again before punching out shapes). Melt chocolate and tahini in a bowl in a microwave in 20-second bursts, stirring after each, until chocolate is melted (or melt in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water; do not let bowl touch water). Stir to combine and season with salt. Spread filling over whole cookies; top with cut-out cookies. Cookies can be assembled 5 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Zebra-Striped Shortbread Cookies
Category: cookies
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 27 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, divided, 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided, 1/3 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder, 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, 2/3 cup granulated sugar, 1/4 cup powdered sugar, 1 large egg yolk, 1 tsp. vanilla extract or paste, 1 large egg, beaten to blend, 1/4 cup sanding sugar (any color)

Cooking instructions:
Whisk 1 1/3 cups flour and 3/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Whisk cocoa powder, remaining 1 cup flour, and remaining 3/4 tsp. salt in another medium bowl. These are the bases for your chocolate and vanilla doughs. Beat butter, granulated sugar, and powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until smooth. Divide mixture between the 2 bowls of dry ingredients (about 1 cup in each). Scrape vanilla mixture back into stand mixer bowl (save the mixing bowl) and beat on low speed just until combined. Return to reserved bowl. Repeat process with chocolate mixture. Arrange 2 large sheets of parchment paper on a work surface. Dollop one-quarter of chocolate dough in the center of each sheet and pat into rough 6x2" rectangles. Dollop one-quarter of vanilla dough on top of each chocolate slab and pat into rectangles the same size and shape so that you have 2 layers each. Repeat entire process so you have 4 alternating layers. Tightly press stacked dough into cylinders about 1 1/2" wide and 8" long, using the parchment to help you. Wrap logs in plastic wrap and chill until very firm, at least 2 hours. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Working one at a time, unwrap dough and brush with egg. Carefully sprinkle surface with sanding sugar and roll logs in sugar to coat well (really press dough into sugar so it sticks). Slice into rounds a generous 1/4" thick, rotating after every few cuts to keep slices round. Arrange cookies on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2" apart. Bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are just set, 12–14 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets. Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled. Cookies can be baked 5 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Pistachio-Rose Shortbread Squares
Category: cookies
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 25 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, 1 large egg, 2 Tbsp. rose rooibos tea or other rooibos tea, crushed, 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 cup raw pistachios, chopped, 1/4 cup freeze-dried raspberries, 1/4 cup pink or red sanding sugar

Cooking instructions:
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat powdered sugar and butter in a large bowl until aerated and pale, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment.) Scrape down sides of bowl, then beat 2 minutes more. Reduce mixer speed to medium, add egg, and beat until well incorporated. Add tea, lemon zest, and vanilla and beat, scraping down sides of bowl, until combined, about 30 seconds more. Reduce mixer speed to low and beat in dry ingredients, followed by pistachios. Stir dough a few times with a spatula, making sure to get to bottom of bowl. Turn out dough onto a clean work surface and divide into quarters. Working one quarter at a time, place dough on a sheet of parchment paper and pat with your hands into a log, then pull the parchment up around the log and, using the parchment to help contain the dough, press it firmly against your work surface, rotating and squaring off edges until you have a long 1"-thick rectangle. Wrap parchment-wrapped dough tightly in plastic wrap and chill at least 3 hours. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 325°F. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Unwrap dough and let sit at room temperature 10–15 minutes. Pulverize raspberries into a fine powder in a food processor or spice mill. Transfer to a plate and mix in sanding sugar.
