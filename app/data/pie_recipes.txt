Recipe: Fresh Fruit Tart With Almond Press-In Crust
Category: pie
Complexity: 16 ingredients, 32 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 large egg yolks, 1 cup all-purpose flour, ½ cup almond flour (such as Bob’s Red Mill Super-Fine Natural Almond Flour) or ½ cup all-purpose flour, 3 Tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ½ cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 2 cups whole milk, 1 tsp. vanilla paste or 1½ tsp. vanilla extract, 4 large egg yolks, ⅓ cup sugar, ¼ cup cornstarch, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 12 oz. fresh blueberries, 6 oz. fresh blackberries, halved if very large, Special Equipment: A (9"-diameter) springform pan or tart pan with removable bottom

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in the middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Whisk egg yolks and 1 Tbsp. cold water in a small bowl to combine. Whisk all-purpose flour, almond flour, sugar, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and rub and smash into dry ingredients with your fingers to create large, shaggy pieces (you want some pieces that are flat and thin and some that are large and irregular). Drizzle egg yolk mixture over flour and, using a fork or your fingers, toss into dough to incorporate. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it will still look a little dry; although, if it looks too dry and doesn't come together, add 1–2 Tbsp. more water, but only if needed). Turn dough out onto a clean work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times. Divide dough in half, stack pieces, and press down firmly to smash together. Repeat process until dough is well combined and becomes slightly sticky, 2—3 more times. Press dough into bottom and 1" up sides of pan and prick all over with a fork. Freeze until very firm, 20–30 minutes. Bake crust until deep golden brown all over, 35–40 minutes. Let cool. Do Ahead: Crust can be baked 2 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Bring milk and vanilla paste to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Remove from heat. Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in a medium bowl, starting slowly—it won’t want to combine easily at first—then vigorously whisk until mixture is very pale yellow and very thick, about 1 minute (the sugar should be nearly dissolved at this point). Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture. Return custard base to saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly. Simmer, still whisking constantly, until custard is thickened and has no cornstarch taste, about 3 minutes. Remove custard from heat and add butter a couple of pieces at a time, whisking until fully melted before adding more, until all of the butter is incorporated. Transfer to a medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing directly against surface. Let cool. Vigorously whisk custard until smooth and slightly loosened. Scrape into crust and smooth surface. Top with berries. Do Ahead: Custard can be made 4 days ahead. Keep chilled.

Recipe: Peach and Sesame Crumble
Category: pie
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 28 steps

Ingredients needed:
⅓ cup raw sesame seeds, 1 lemon, 2½ lb. peaches (6–7), thinly sliced, ⅓ cup plus 1¼ cups sugar, 1¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, 1 cup all-purpose flour, ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, ½ tsp. ground cinnamon, ⅓ cup tahini, 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil, 1—2 tsp. cornstarch, Vanilla ice cream (for serving; optional)

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in top third of oven; preheat to 375°F. Toast sesame seeds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 12–15 minutes. Immediately transfer to a large bowl. Meanwhile, finely grate zest from lemon into a medium bowl; set aside. Place peaches in a 13x9" baking dish. Halve lemon and squeeze 1 Tbsp. juice over peaches, then sprinkle ⅓ cup sugar and ¾ tsp. salt over. Toss to gently combine, then let sit while you prep the topping, at least 20 minutes. Add flour and remaining 1¼ cups sugar and 1 tsp. salt to bowl with sesame seeds. Whisk to combine. Add butter and cinnamon to bowl with lemon zest. Microwave until butter is melted, about 1 minute. (Or, if you don't have a microwave, melt butter with cinnamon and lemon zest in a small saucepan over medium.) Whisk in tahini and oil. Scrape tahini mixture into dry ingredients and mix until incorporated (mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand). The peaches should look juicy at this point. Add 1 tsp. cornstarch. If they’re really juicy, add another 1 tsp. Gently toss to combine. (If your peaches happen to be not-so-ripe and aren't juicy, don't add any cornstarch.) Squeeze topping into big clumps, then break off uneven pieces and scatter over peaches. Bake crumble until topping is well browned and firm, peaches are tender, and juices are bubbling, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly. Divide crumble among shallow bowls and add a scoop of ice cream if desired.

Recipe: Pear and Hazelnut Frangipane Tart
Category: pie
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 11 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup hazelnuts, toasted, loose skins rubbed off in a kitchen towel, and cooled, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 stick (6 tablespoons) cold unsalted butter, softened, 2 large eggs, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, 1 tart shell, 3 firm-ripe Bosc or Anjou pears, 1/4 cup apricot preserves, heated and strained

Cooking instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Pulse hazelnuts with 1/4 cup sugar in a food processor until finely ground, then add flour and pulse to combine. Beat together butter and remaining 1/4 cup sugar with an electric mixer at moderately high speed until pale and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in extracts. Reduce speed to low and mix in nut mixture until just combined. Spread frangipane filling evenly in tart shell. Peel, halve, and core pears, then cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices, holding slices together to keep pear shape intact. Arrange pears decoratively on filling, fanning slices slightly. Bake until pears are golden and frangipane is puffed and golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Brush pears (not filling) with preserves and cool tart completely in pan on rack, then remove side of pan.

Recipe: Salted PB&J; Ice Cream Pie
Category: pie
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 31 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 sleeve (110 g) Ritz crackers or other cracker of your choice, ⅓ cup (45 g) raw peanuts or other nut or seed, finely chopped, ⅓ cup (67 g; packed) light or dark brown sugar, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, 3 large eggs, ½ cup (100 g; packed) light or dark brown sugar, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, ½ cup (128 g) natural peanut butter or other natural nut or seed butter, 1½ cups heavy cream, ⅓ cup (100 g) grape jelly (preferably Bonne Maman) or other jelly, jam, or compote

Cooking instructions:
Preheat oven to 275°F. Place crackers in a deep pie dish (a shallower one will work but you may have some filling left over) and gently crush with your hands until you have a mix of dime-size pieces, small crumbs, and everything in between. Add peanuts, brown sugar, and salt and toss to combine. Drizzle in butter and toss to evenly coat. Using your hands and the bottom of a measuring cup, press firmly and evenly into bottom and up sides of dish. (Mixture will look and feel crumbly, but it will hold together when baked.) Bake crust until a shade darker, 20–25 minutes. Let cool. Do Ahead: Crust can be baked 3 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature, or freeze up to 1 month. Pour water into a medium saucepan to come 1½" up the sides and bring to a bare simmer over medium-low heat. Whisk eggs, brown sugar, and salt in a large heatproof bowl just to combine (or use the bowl of a stand mixer if you’ve got one). Set over saucepan (bowl should not touch water) and heat egg mixture, stirring constantly with a heatproof rubber spatula, until sugar dissolves, about 4 minutes (mixture will no longer feel gritty when rubbed between your fingers). If you are concerned about undercooked eggs, heat mixture longer, still stirring constantly, until an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F, about 3 minutes more. Remove bowl from heat and add vanilla to egg mixture. Using an electric mixer, beat on high speed until thick and pale and doubled in volume, about 10 minutes. (Or, if using a stand mixer, beat with the whisk attachment, 6–8 minutes.) Using spatula, mix peanut butter in another large bowl to loosen up and smooth out. Stir one third of egg mixture into peanut butter to lighten, then gently fold in half of remaining egg mixture, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl, until just combined. Repeat with remaining egg mixture (it will lose a lot of volume, and that’s okay). Starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high, beat cream in the same bowl you used for egg mixture (no need to wash) until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gently fold into peanut butter mixture and scrape into crust. Dollop jelly all over; swirl with a butter knife. (For more defined swirls, freeze pie 30 minutes before adding jelly.) Freeze at least 8 hours before serving. To slice, run a chef’s knife under hot water to warm up the blade, then wipe to clean and dry between slices. Use an offset spatula or fork to loosen slices from dish. If pie is frozen very hard, you may need to let it temper in the fridge 30 minutes before serving. Do Ahead: Pie can be made 2 weeks ahead. Wrap tightly and freeze.

Recipe: Stone Fruit Custard Tart
Category: pie
Complexity: 20 ingredients, 25 steps

Ingredients needed:
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, ½ cup (65 g) raw pistachios, divided, 1 large egg, ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) light brown sugar, 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ¾ tsp. baking powder, 3 large eggs, ⅔ cup (packed; 133 g) light brown sugar, ¼ cup sour cream, 1 Tbsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 1 tsp. ground cardamom, ¾ tsp. ground ginger, ¾ tsp.(packed) finely grated orange zest, ¾ tsp. kosher salt, 3 Tbsp (23 g) all-purpose flour, 2½–3 lb. stone fruit (such as peaches, nectarines, apricots, and plums; all about the same size), cut into sixths or eighths, depending on their size, 1 Tbsp. coarse sugar, Powdered sugar, whipped cream, or crème fraîche (for serving; optional), A 9"-diameter springform pan

Cooking instructions:
Preheat an oven to 375°F. Cook butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until it foams, then browns, 5–8 minutes. Set aside. Pulse pistachios in a food processor until finely ground. Transfer 4 Tbsp. to a small bowl; set aside. Scrape reserved browned butter over pistachios in food processor; add egg, brown sugar, flour, salt, and baking powder. Pulse until incorporated, then process, scraping down sides as needed, until mixture looks like wet sand and holds together when squeezed in your hand, about 2 minutes. Press dough evenly into bottom and about 2" up sides of pan with a straight-sided glass or measuring cup. Chill while you make the filling. Process eggs and brown sugar in clean food processor until eggs are well combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down sides; add sour cream, vanilla bean paste, cardamom, ginger, orange zest, and salt. Sprinkle flour and 2 Tbsp. reserved pistachios over; process until smooth, about 1 minute. Starting at the edges of the chilled tart shell and working inward, arrange stone fruit in snug concentric circles, standing each wedge up so one tip is raised and rounded skin side is pressed against crust. Carefully pour custard around fruit (fruit should not be completely covered). Sprinkle coarse sugar over. Bake pie until crust is golden brown and filling is puffed and set in the center (it shouldn’t wobble when gently shaken), 70–75 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and scatter remaining reserved 2 Tbsp. pistachios over. Let cool, then chill, uncovered, until fully set. Unmold tart. Dust with powdered sugar and/or top with dollops of whipped cream or crème fraîche if desired. Serve chilled or room temperature.

Recipe: Peach Cobbler
Category: pie
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 17 steps

Ingredients needed:
10 large peaches (about 4½ pounds), unpeeled, cut into 1-inch chunks, Zest and juice of 1 large lemon, ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened, 2 cups sugar, divided, 1½ cups (about 192 grams) all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, ¾ cup whole milk, ½ cup hot tap water, Heavy cream, for serving

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Put the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top. In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1½ cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Plop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it’s no more than about ½ inch thick in any one place. Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It’s a strange method, but it works.) Bake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry—be sure to check in a few places.) Let the cobbler sit for about a half an hour to firm up before serving warm in big bowls, with heavy cream poured on top.

Recipe: Dad's Peach Cobbler
Category: pie
Complexity: 15 ingredients, 21 steps

Ingredients needed:
3 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 3 tablespoons sugar, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, ¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, cut into cubes and chilled, 1 cup ice-cold water, plus more as needed, 3½ pounds fresh peaches, pitted and quartered or two (29-ounce) cans peaches, drained, 1 cup sugar, ¼ cup all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, ½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, Fine sea salt, 1 large egg, beaten, Ground cinnamon, for dusting, Sugar, for dusting, Ice cream, for serving

Cooking instructions:
Make the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and 2 teaspoons salt until just combined. Add the butter and pulse a few more times until the mixture is coarse but the butter pieces are still visible. Slowly add the ice water and pulse to form a dough, six to eight pulses. If the dough looks and feels very dry, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Divide the dough in half and wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap; flatten each piece into a disc. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour. Make the filling: In a large bowl, mix together the peaches, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 375ºF. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and cut in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll it into a 9 x 13-inch rectangle, about ¼ inch thick. Set aside and repeat with the second piece of dough. Line a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with one of the dough rectangles, pressing any excess dough against the sides of the dish. Pour in the peach filling and spread it evenly. Place the second rectangle of dough on top of the peaches and tuck the excess dough into corners. Brush the dough with the beaten egg and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. Pierce the top with the tip of a sharp knife in several places to allow steam to escape while baking. Bake until the top crust is golden brown, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Let cool on a rack before serving. Serve with ice cream.

Recipe: Pecan-Rye Pumpkin Pie
Category: pie
Complexity: 23 ingredients, 50 steps

Ingredients needed:
¼ cup rye flour or all-purpose flour, 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar, ¾ tsp. kosher salt, 1½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, ¾ cup (1½ sticks) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 large egg white, beaten to blend, 3 large eggs, 1 large egg yolk, 1 (15-oz.) can Libby’s 100% Pure Pumpkin, ¾ cup heavy cream, ¼ cup granulated sugar, 2 Tbsp. rye whiskey, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground ginger, ¼ tsp. freshly grated nutmeg, ¼ tsp. ground cardamom, Small pinch of ground cloves, 8 Tbsp. light brown sugar, divided, 3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, divided, 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt, divided, 1½ cups whole pecans, 1 Tbsp. pure maple syrup, Whipped cream (for serving; optional)

Cooking instructions:
Whisk rye flour, sugar, salt, and 1½ cups all-purpose flour in a large bowl to combine. Add butter and toss to evenly coat. Working quickly and aggressively, use your fingers to rub butter into flour to create large shaggy pieces of dough (you want some pieces of butter that are flat and thin and some that are large and chunky). Drizzle 5 Tbsp. ice water over, running your fingers through flour mixture to evenly distribute. Knead dough in bowl until it starts to come together (it should look a little dry, but add more ice water by the teaspoonful if needed, just until dough comes together). Turn dough out onto a work surface and knead 1 or 2 more times, pressing to incorporate shaggy edges and any loose bits. Dust surface and dough lightly with flour to keep dough from sticking. Using your hands, form dough into about a 7x5" rectangle. Using your rolling pin, gently tap and press dough to compact and tidy up edges. Roll out dough, dusting dough and surface as needed, until 3 times longer than when you started. Fold dough over onto itself in thirds like a letter to make a square. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400°F. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to about a 12" round. Wrap dough around your rolling pin and unfurl into a standard 9"-diameter pie dish. Gently lift dough so it slumps down into edges of dish. Trim overhang and crimp as desired. Line crust with parchment paper or foil. Place dish on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until edges of crust start to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove parchment and weights. Decrease oven temperature to 350° and bake crust until edges are golden, 20–25 minutes. Remove dish from oven and brush 1 Tbsp. egg white over bottom of crust. Return to oven and bake until crust is golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the egg creates a water-resistant coating that helps prevent the custard from making the bottom soggy). Reserve remaining egg white for topping. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead; keep chilled. Crust can be baked 3 days ahead; store tightly wrapped at room temperature. While your crust is baking, combine eggs, egg yolk, pie filling, cream, granulated sugar, whiskey, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, cloves, 6 Tbsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. butter, and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a large bowl and blend with an immersion blender until smooth; try not to aerate. (Alternatively, you can whisk mixture well and blend in 2 batches in a blender until smooth and homogenous.) Pour into crust and bake pie (still at 350°F) until filling is puffed and mostly set with just a slight wobble in the center when gently shaken, 40–45 minutes. Just before the pie is done baking, toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8–10 minutes. Whisk reserved egg white, remaining 2 Tbsp. brown sugar, and remaining ¾ tsp. salt in a small bowl until foamy, about 30 seconds. Add syrup and remaining 1 Tbsp. butter; whisk just to combine. Add pecans and toss to coat. Carefully remove pie from oven and top with pecan mixture, allowing any excess egg white mixture to drip back into the bowl. Return pie to oven and bake until filling is completely set (a tester or paring knife inserted into the center should come out clean) and nuts are not tacky to the touch, 8–10 minutes. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool, at least 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream if desired. Do Ahead: Pie can be baked 1 day ahead. Store uncovered in a cool oven or at room temperature.

Place saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer, whisking often and making sure to get into corners of pan, 8–10 minutes (mixture should be bubbling and thickened). Reduce heat and continue to simmer, whisking constantly, 3 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes, whisking every minute. Add butter to filling and whisk until melted and fully incorporated. Scrape filling into pie crust; smooth surface. Chill until cold and set, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. Combine egg whites, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer or another large heatproof bowl; set over a large saucepan filled with 1" simmering water (bowl shouldn’t touch the water). Heat, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved and mixture is warm to the touch, about 4 minutes. Fit bowl onto mixer fitted with whisk attachment (or use an electric mixer) and beat on medium-high speed until meringue is more than tripled in volume and medium peaks form, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip (or a resealable plastic bag will work—just snip off a corner after bag is filled). Pipe meringue over filling and toast with a kitchen torch or under the broiler. Do Ahead: Pie (without meringue) can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.

Whisk sugar, salt, and 2⅔ cups flour in a large bowl. Add butter and, using your fingers, smash each piece into a thin disk. Take your time doing this and don’t feel compelled to break butter into even smaller pieces. Drizzle ⅔ cup ice water over, dispersing it as widely as possible, and mix with a rubber spatula to bring mixture together into a shaggy mass. Turn dough out onto a surface and work together with your hands, pushing and flattening until dough holds together when squeezed in your palm but some streaks of dry flour are still visible. Divide dough into 2 portions. Flatten 1 portion of dough into an 8"-diameter disk. Cut into quarters, stack pieces on top of one another, and flatten dough with a rolling pin to about half of its original height. At this point dough should hold together with no dry spots remaining, and have nice big flakes of butter showing. Use a bench scraper or a large knife to clean any clingy bits of dough from surface. Dust surface with flour, then dust top of dough with flour. Roll out to a ¼"–⅜"-thick round. Wrap dough around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9"-diameter pie dish. Unfurl into dish, then lift edges and allow dough to slump down into dish. Trim overhang to an even 1" (there will be some excess). Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Cover and chill until very cold, at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours (cover tightly if chilling longer than 1 hour). Repeat process with remaining dough and another pie dish. Or form into a 1½"-thick disk, wrap in plastic, and chill up to 3 days (or freeze up to 1 month). Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 400°F. Lay 2 sheets of parchment paper over dough and fill with pie weights or dried beans (they should fill the dish). Set on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet (this will keep any butter drips from smoking up your oven). Bake until edges are golden brown and bottom is opaque (carefully lift parchment to check), 30–35 minutes. Remove from oven; reduce oven temperature to 300°F. Lift out parchment and weights. Bake crust until evenly chestnut brown all over, 10–15 minutes. If baking both crusts, turn oven dial back up to 400°F and let oven preheat; repeat with remaining crust.

Recipe: Black-Bottom Hazelnut Pie
Category: pie
Complexity: 13 ingredients, 44 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 tsp. granulated sugar, 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, frozen for 15 minutes, 3 cups blanched hazelnuts, 4 oz. bittersweet chocolate, chopped, 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 1 cup (packed) light brown sugar, 1 Tbsp. instant espresso powder, 1 Tbsp. vanilla extract, 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. light corn syrup, 1 tsp. kosher salt, divided, 3 large eggs, room temperature, beaten to blend

Cooking instructions:
Pulse granulated sugar, salt, and 1 1/4 cups flour in a food processor to combine. Add butter and pulse until coarse, pea-size crumbs form, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add 2 Tbsp. ice water and process until dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers: If it’s very crumbly, pulse in more ice water 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not overprocess. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a ball. Knead a few times to combine, then flatten into a disk with smooth edges (no cracks). Cover tightly and chill at least 1 hour. Roll out dough to a 13" round on a lightly floured surface. Roll dough loosely around rolling pin and transfer to a standard 9"-diameter pie dish. Lightly press dough into pan, leaving a 1" overhang; trim excess. Fold overhang under and crimp as desired. Chill until cold, about 30 minutes. Do Ahead: Dough can be made and shaped into disk 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or freeze up to 3 months. Thaw before rolling. Place racks in bottom third and center of oven; preheat to 375°F. Place a rimmed baking sheet on bottom rack to preheat. Spread hazelnuts on another rimmed baking sheet and bake on center rack until light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Reserve 1 cup whole hazelnuts to decorate pie; finely chop remaining hazelnuts. Melt chocolate in a small heatproof bowl set over a small saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let water touch bowl); stir constantly until chocolate is melted and smooth. (You can also do this in a microwave.) Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Spread chocolate in bottom of pie shell with the back of a spoon and chill until set, about 15 minutes. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat or in a microwave in a microwave-safe bowl. Pour butter into a large bowl. Whisk in brown sugar, espresso powder, vanilla, 1 cup corn syrup, and 3/4 tsp. salt until well incorporated. Whisk in eggs, then fold in chopped hazelnuts. Pour filling into pie crust (do not overfill). Toss whole hazelnuts with remaining 2 Tbsp. corn syrup and 1/4 tsp. salt in a small bowl and arrange on top of pie. Place pie dish on preheated baking sheet on bottom rack and bake 20 minutes. Rotate baking sheet, move to center rack, and continue to bake, covering edges with foil or a pie shield if crust starts to brown too much, until crust is golden brown and filling is almost set with a slight jiggle in center of pie, 20–25 minutes more. Transfer pie to a wire rack and let cool before slicing, about 3 hours. Do Ahead: Filling (before decorating) can be made 1 day ahead. Bring to room temperature before baking. Pie can be made 2 days ahead. Cover loosely with foil and store at room temperature.

Preheat oven to 350°F. Pulse sesame sticks and granulated sugar in a food processor until finely ground. Add butter and continue to pulse until dough sticks together when pressed with your fingertips. Transfer to pie pan and press evenly into bottom and up sides with a flat measuring cup. Chill in the freezer until firm, about 15 minutes. Bake crust until golden brown and set, 12–15 minutes. If the crust has slouched while baking, use measuring cup to fix. Let cool. Mix gelatin into 1/4 cup warm water in a small bowl; set aside to bloom. Heat coconut milk, cream, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large heavy saucepan over medium-high until simmering, about 4 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low. Whisk cornstarch, salt, and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a medium bowl. Add eggs and continue to whisk until well combined. Whisking constantly, slowly pour half of milk mixture into egg mixture to temper. Pour egg mixture back into pan, stir in rice, and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring constantly and scraping bottom and sides of pan until thick and big bubbles are rising to the surface, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in gelatin until dissolved, then transfer to a large bowl or resealable container. Let cool slightly. Place plastic wrap directly on surface of pudding to prevent a crust from forming and chill at least 2 hours and preferably overnight. Bring coconut milk and brown sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisking to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often with a rubber spatula, until reduced to a thick, glossy sauce, 10–15 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and salt. Pour caramel into cooled crust and tilt to coat bottom of crust. Freeze until set, about 15 minutes. Beat cream in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment until soft peaks form, 3–4 minutes. Add rum, powdered sugar, and salt and continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Chill two-thirds (about 3 cups) of the whipped cream until ready to use. Fold remaining cream into chilled rice pudding. Fill pie shell with pudding. Chill at least 2 hours and up to overnight. When ready to serve, re-whip rum cream until it holds stiff peaks and pile on top of rice pudding. Sprinkle with toasted coconut and slice to serve.

Recipe: Cranberry Linzer Tart
Category: pie
Complexity: 19 ingredients, 29 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 lb. fresh (or frozen) cranberries, 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar, 1 Tbsp. finely grated peeled ginger, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, Pinch of kosher salt, 1 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1 1/2 cups walnuts, 1 cup granulated sugar, 2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest, 1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, 1/4 tsp. ground cloves, 1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. baking powder, 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 14 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 2 large eggs, Powdered sugar (for serving), A 10"-diameter fluted tart pan with removable bottom

Cooking instructions:
Bring cranberries, sugar, ginger, butter, and salt to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring often to prevent scorching and help dissolve sugar. Continue to cook, stirring often, until cranberries burst, mixture is syrupy, and pot is visible when a wooden spoon is dragged across the bottom (mixture should be reduced to about 1 3/4 cups), 10–12 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in lemon zest. Chill until cold, at least 1 hour. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Let cool. Pulse walnuts, granulated sugar, lemon zest, cinnamon, salt, cloves, nutmeg, baking powder, and 2 cups flour in a food processor until nuts are finely ground. Add butter and pulse until largest pieces are pea-size. Add 1 egg and process in long pulses until dough forms a ball around the blade. Divide dough in half. Wrap one half in plastic, flattening into a 1/2"-thick disk. Press the remaining half into tart pan, working it across bottom and up sides with floured hands to create an even layer. Chill the dough in the pan and the wrapped dough until cold, at least 1 hour and up to 3 days. Scrape filling into crust and spread into an even layer. Unwrap remaining dough and roll out on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, to a 1/8"-thick round. Cut dough into 8 strips. Arrange strips over top of tart in a crosshatch pattern (this dough is delicate,so don’t fuss with strips too much once they’re on the tart). Pinch off excess dough and press strips into edges to adhere. Chill 15–20 minutes. Beat remaining egg in a small bowl and brush over crust. Bake tart until crust is golden brown around the edges and golden across surface and filling is bubbling, 45–55 minutes. Let cool. Just before serving, remove ring from pan and dust tart with powdered sugar. Filling can be made 3 days ahead. Transfer to a nonreactive container; cover and chill. Tart can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Recipe: Butternut Squash Tarte Tatin
Category: pie
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 47 steps

Ingredients needed:
6 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, divided, plus more for pan, 1 large butternut squash (about 3 1/2 lb.), 1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar, divided, 1/4 tsp. kosher salt, plus more, 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 Shortcut Puff Pastry, 1 cup chilled heavy cream, 1 Tbsp. powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, All-purpose flour (for surface)

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Butter a 10" springform pan or cake pan and line bottom with a parchment paper round. Cut off neck from squash. Peel neck and bulb until you reveal the orange flesh underneath (you might need to take off a few layers). Slice both pieces in half lengthwise; scoop out seeds. Slice all squash pieces crosswise 1/4" thick. Arrange on a rimmed baking sheet. Melt 3 Tbsp. butter in a small saucepan and drizzle over squash. Sprinkle with ¼ cup granulated sugar and a pinch of salt and toss to coat. Arrange squash in a single layer (use a second rimmed baking sheet if needed) and roast until tender and just starting to curl around the edges but not yet browned, 30–35 minutes. Let cool. Carefully move oven rack to highest position and increase oven temperature to 400°. Meanwhile, cut remaining 3 Tbsp. butter into pieces and set aside. Bring lemon juice, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, and 3 Tbsp. water to a boil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring with a heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved. Continue to cook, swirling pan often (do not stir), until caramel is light amber in color, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and add reserved butter a piece at a time, stirring after each addition until incorporated and smooth. Once all the butter has been added, stir in vanilla and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt. Pour caramel into prepared springform pan and tilt to coat bottom. Let cool. Starting with slices from the neck, layer squash in an overlapping rosette pattern over caramel. Sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar. Arrange remaining squash over first layer, placing pieces wherever needed to create an even thickness of squash across entire tart (this layer doesn’t need to be pretty since it won’t be visible). Sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar and chill while you roll out the puff pastry. Let pastry sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured surface, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking and rotating a few times, to a round that’s a little over 11". Using pan as a template, trim excess dough to make an 11" round. Using a fork, prick pastry in 12–15 places. Drape pastry over squash and use a spoon to tuck edges in slightly between squash and sides of pan. Bake tarte Tatin 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue to bake until pastry is puffed and golden brown, 45–50 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool in pan 10 minutes. If using a springform pan, remove ring and carefully invert tarte Tatin onto rack (take care as some of the hot caramel could drip). If using a cake pan, set rack upside down over pan and invert tarte Tatin onto rack. Let cool 20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk cream in a small bowl to soft peaks. Beat in powdered sugar and cinnamon. Serve tarte Tatin warm topped with dollops of cinnamon whipped cream. Tarte Tatin can be baked 10 hours ahead. Store loosely wrapped at room temperature. Reheat in a 250°F oven.

Recipe: Glazed and Flaky Apple Tart
Category: pie
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 36 steps

Ingredients needed:
1/2 cup sliced almonds, 6 medium sweet-tart apples (such as Pink Lady, Honeycrisp, or Winesap), 1 lemon, halved, 1/2 cup pure maple syrup, 1/4 cup brandy, preferably apple, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, Pinch of kosher salt, 2 Tbsp. raw sugar, divided, 1 Tbsp. all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 1 large egg, beaten to blend, Shortcut Puff Pastry, Vanilla ice cream (for serving)

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 275°F. Peel apples; cut in half. Using a melon baller or teaspoon, scoop out cores. Rub cut sides of lemon all over apples, then place apples cut side down in a 13x9" baking dish. Squeeze lemon halves over and add maple syrup, brandy, vanilla, and salt. Cover tightly with foil and bake until juices are bubbling and apples are tender but still intact (poke through foil with a tester or toothpick to check), 60–80 minutes. Uncover and let cool. Increase oven temperature to 400°F. Meanwhile, toss almonds, 1 Tbsp. raw sugar, and 1 Tbsp. flour in a small bowl; set aside. Let puff pastry sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften slightly. Roll out on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, dusting with more flour as needed to prevent sticking and rotating once or twice, to a 16x12" rectangle. Slide parchment paper with pastry onto a large rimmed baking sheet. Trim around sides to straighten and tidy edges, then cut off a 1" strip from each side (you’ll have 4 strips). Brush around edge of rectangle with egg, then place strips on top, aligning with edges. Trim any overhang from corners. Brush rim you just created with egg and sprinkle with remaining 1 Tbsp. raw sugar. Scatter reserved almond mixture over pastry, staying inside the rim. Gently arrange apples on top of almond mixture; reserve juices left in dish. Chill tart 15 minutes. Bake tart 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and continue to bake until pastry is deep golden brown and puffed, 45–55 minutes. Meanwhile, scrape reserved apple juices into a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, swirling pan often, until syrupy (you should have 2–4 Tbsp.), 6–8 minutes. Remove glaze from heat. Remove tart from oven and brush glaze over apples. Serve warm or room temperature with scoops of ice cream. Tart can be baked 10 hours ahead. Store loosely wrapped at room temperature. Reheat in a 250°F oven if desired.

Recipe: Dried Fig and Marsala Tart
Category: pie
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 25 steps

Ingredients needed:
500g dried figs, 50g golden raisins, 100ml dry Marsala, 100g natural raw granulated sugar, 50g butter, 175g cold butter, 225g all-purpose flour, 2 Tbsp natural raw granulated sugar, 2 large egg yolks, Heavy cream, ice cream, or crème fraîche, You will also need a 24cm round Tatin tin or shallow, non-stick cake tin with a fixed base.

Cooking instructions:
Set the oven at 400°F/200°C/Gas 6. Put the figs and raisins into a mixing bowl, pour over the Marsala and leave to stand for forty-five minutes, stirring occasionally. Cut the cold butter into small cubes and rub into the flour, either with your fingertips or using a food processor. Work until you have what looks like coarse, fresh breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar. Add the egg yolks to the butter and flour. Mix together until you have a soft dough, then turn out on to a floured board and knead briefly, for just a minute. Shape the dough into a smooth, fat cylinder. Wrap it in greaseproof paper or clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for thirty minutes. Place the Tatin mould or a frying pan over a moderate heat. (If you will be baking the tart in a cake tin, use a frying pan to make the caramel, otherwise you will damage your tin.) Add the Marsala from the dried fruit, leaving the fruit behind in the bowl, then add the sugar. Bring to the boil and leave to form a thin caramel. If you are using a Tatin mould, remove from the heat. If you are using a cake tin, pour the caramel from the frying pan into the tin. Cut the butter into small cubes and scatter it over the caramel. Place the plumped-up figs on the base of the tin in a single layer (neatly or not, as you wish), then scatter over the raisins, pushing them into any gaps. Roll out the pastry a little larger than the Tatin mould or cake tin. With the help of the rolling pin—it is very fragile—lift the pastry into the mould or tin, pressing it gently into place over the figs. Tuck in any overhanging pastry. Bake in the preheated oven for about thirty minutes, until the pastry is golden. Remove from the oven and leave to settle for ten to fifteen minutes. Place a large serving plate on top of the tart, then, using oven gloves, hold the tin and plate firmly and carefully turn them over, leaving the tart to slide out on to the plate. Serve warm with cream, ice cream or crème fraîche.
