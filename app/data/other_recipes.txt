Recipe: Grilling Cheese With Sweet Peppers and Black Lentils
Category: other
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 19 steps

Ingredients needed:
Kosher salt, ¾ cup black beluga lentils, 3 Tbsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar, 1 Tbsp. honey, 5 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, Freshly ground black pepper, 8 oz. grilling cheese (such as bread, Halloumi, or paneer), torn into 2" pieces, 1 lb. sweet mini peppers, ribs and seeds removed, halved lengthwise, cut into thirds if large, ½ tsp. dried oregano, ¼ cup (packed) basil leaves, torn if large, Flaky sea salt

Cooking instructions:
Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add lentils and cook until just tender but not falling apart (they should hold their shape), about 20 minutes. Drain well. Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, honey, and 3 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl to combine; season with kosher salt and pepper. Set dressing aside. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add cheese and cook, turning occasionally, until heated through and brown and crispy on all sides, about 5 minutes total. (Some varieties of paneer are made without salt; if using one of these, season your pieces of cheese while cooking.) Transfer to a plate. Add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil to same pan, then add sweet peppers and oregano. Season with kosher salt and black pepper and cook over medium-high, stirring and pressing down occasionally on sweet peppers with a wooden spoon so they make good contact with the pan, until softened and blistered in spots, 20–25 minutes. Remove from heat. Add warm lentils and reserved dressing to pan and toss to combine, then toss in cheese. Transfer sweet pepper mixture to a platter or plates. Top with basil and season with sea salt and more black pepper.

Recipe: Lemony Glazed Yogurt Doughnuts
Category: other
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 18 steps

Ingredients needed:
2½ tsp. baking powder, 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more, 2 large egg yolks, 1 cup whole-milk Greek yogurt, ½ cup granulated sugar, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, Vegetable oil (for frying; 6–8 cups), Zest of ¼ lemon, 1 cup powdered sugar, Special Equipment: A deep-fry thermometer

Cooking instructions:
Whisk baking powder, 2 cups flour, and 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine. Whisk egg yolks, yogurt, granulated sugar, butter, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Add dry ingredients to egg mixture with a spoon or rubber spatula until dough comes together and is smooth with no spots of dry flour remaining. Turn out dough onto a well-floured large sheet of parchment or wax paper (you can be generous with the flour since you’ll brush off the excess later). Dust dough with more flour, place another large sheet of parchment or waxed paper over, and roll to ½" thick. Remove top sheet of parchment and brush off any excess flour with a dry pastry brush. Punch out circles with a 3½"-diameter biscuit or cookie cutter, glass, or mug. Punch out centers of rounds with a 1"-diamter cutter or plastic twist-off bottle cap (or poke a hole with a chopstick, then gently pull hole open to widen the center). Reroll any scraps and punch out additional doughnuts and holes. Fit a large pot with thermometer; pour in oil to come 1½" up the sides of the pot. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°F. Fry doughnuts, turning halfway through, until puffy and a color somewhere between golden brown and mahogany, about 4 minutes total (time will be slightly less for doughnut holes). Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a wire rack and let cool 10 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk lemon zest, powdered sugar, a tiny pinch of salt, and ¼ cup water in a small bowl until a smooth glaze forms. Dip each side of doughnuts and holes into glaze, letting excess run off before returning to rack. Eat as soon as you can’t stand the suspense anymore.

Recipe: Whole Wheat–Oat Waffles
Category: other
Complexity: 13 ingredients, 20 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 lemon, zest removed in wide strips, halved, ⅓ cup granulated sugar, 1 (10–12-oz.) bag frozen blueberries, 1 Tbsp. cornstarch, 1 cup (125 g) whole wheat flour, ½ cup plus 2 Tbsp. (60 g) quick-cooking old-fashioned oats, 1 tsp. baking powder, ½ tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. Diamond crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1½ cups plain yogurt (not Greek), 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, plus more room-temperature for serving, 1 large egg, Nonstick vegetable oil spray or melted unsalted butter (for iron)

Cooking instructions:
Bring lemon zest, sugar, and ⅔ cup water to a boil in a heavy medium saucepan, stirring until sugar dissolves. Cook (do not stir) until a thin syrup forms, 6–8 minutes. Add blueberries and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. Transfer 2 Tbsp. syrup to a small bowl, add cornstarch, and stir until smooth. Add back to syrup; simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Fish out lemon zest and discard. Squeeze in lemon juice to taste and let cool slightly. Whisk flour, oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add yogurt, then melted butter, then egg to well. Using a fork, stir together wet ingredients, then mix, incorporating dry ingredients a little at a time, until a lumpy batter forms. Heat waffle iron on medium-low. Lightly coat with nonstick spray and pour a heaping ½ cup batter onto iron (or up to 2 cups if using a larger one). Cook until waffles are golden brown and cooked through, about 5 minutes. (Keep warm on a baking sheet in a 300° oven if desired.) Repeat with remaining batter, coating iron with more nonstick spray as needed. Serve with butter and warm syrup.

Recipe: Kong Jaban (Korean Sweet Black Beans)
Category: other
Complexity: 6 ingredients, 13 steps

Ingredients needed:
1¼ cups dried black beans, rinsed and picked over, 2 quarts dashi or water, plus more if needed, 1 cup soy sauce, ¾ cup sugar, 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds

Cooking instructions:
Soak the beans in enough water to cover them by 3 inches in a covered container in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours. Drain the beans, put them in a pot, and add the dashi or water and soy sauce. Set over medium-high heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook for 1 hour, stirring the beans on a regular basis. The level of liquid will reduce as the beans cook; once it gets to the point where it does not completely cover the beans, you will need to stir more often to ensure that the beans cook evenly. After an hour, the beans should be tender but still retain a little bite. If they are still hard, add more dashi or water and cook for 15 to 20 minutes longer, until the beans are tender with a little bite. Add the sugar, sesame oil, and sesame seeds to the pot and mix well. (It’s important to wait to add the sugar until the beans are tender, as adding it in the beginning will cause the beans to harden when refrigerated.) Let the beans cool slightly, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until chilled. (The beans will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.) Serve the beans cold with hot rice.

Recipe: Camouflage Chocolate Fudge Brownies
Category: other
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 32 steps

Ingredients needed:
Nonstick cooking oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter (for pan), 8 oz. cream cheese (not low-fat), cut into (1") pieces, 3 large eggs, chilled, 1⅓ cups (266 g) sugar, divided, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, divided, ¾ tsp. kosher salt, divided, 1½ tsp. plus ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-process, 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 tsp. instant espresso powder (optional), ½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°F. Lightly coat a 9x9" pan, preferably metal, with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Lightly coat parchment with nonstick spray. Place cream cheese in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (do not let bowl touch water). Heat cream cheese, stirring occasionally, until very soft, about 5 minutes. Remove bowl from heat (leave water simmering). Using a heatproof rubber spatula or wooden spoon, smash and mix cream cheese until smooth. Add 1 egg, ⅓ cup (66 g) sugar, ½ tsp. vanilla, and ¼ tsp. salt and whisk until very smooth. Transfer about half of cream cheese mixture to a small bowl and whisk in 1½ tsp. cocoa powder. Place butter in another medium heatproof bowl. Add espresso powder (if using) and remaining 1 cup (200 g) sugar, ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder, and ½ tsp. salt. Place bowl over saucepan of still simmering water and cook, stirring occasionally once the butter starts to melt, until mixture is homogeneous and too hot to leave your finger in, 7–9 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes. Add remaining 2 eggs and remaining ½ tsp. vanilla to butter mixture one at a time, whisking vigorously after each addition until smooth and glossy. Add flour and mix with spatula or spoon until no longer visible, then vigorously mix another 30 strokes. Scoop out ½ cup brownie batter and set aside. Scrape remaining batter into prepared pan and spread into an even layer. Working quickly, alternate dollops of cocoa–cream cheese mixture and cream cheese mixture over batter. Dollop reserved batter on top (it will be quite thick). Don’t worry if your design looks random and spotted. Bake brownies until center is set and no longer looks wet, 22–25 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool. Using parchment paper overhang, lift brownies out of pan and transfer to a cutting board. Remove parchment paper and cut into sixteen 2¼" squares, wiping knife clean between slices.

Recipe: Cinnamon Sugar Sourdough Waffles
Category: other
Complexity: 15 ingredients, 19 steps

Ingredients needed:
1⁄4 cup (50 g) sugar, 1 tsp (3 g) cinnamon, 1⁄2 cup (120 g) leftover starter, 1 cup (240 ml) milk, whole or 2%, 3 tbsp (42 g) unsalted butter, melted, divided, 1 large egg, 1 cup (120 g) all-purpose flour, 1 tbsp (12 g) sugar, 2 tsp (10 g) baking powder, 1⁄2 tsp fine sea salt, Cooking spray, for coating, 1 cup (165 g) cubed pineapple, Handful of mixed seasonal berries, 1⁄4 cup (30 g) coconut flakes, Maple syrup, to serve

Recipe: Sourdough Rye Brownies
Category: other
Complexity: 14 ingredients, 16 steps

Ingredients needed:
72g (2¾ oz) wholegrain rye flour, 57g (2¼ oz) water, 36g (1½ oz) rye or wheat starter (8–12 hours after last refreshment), 194g (6¾ oz) wholegrain rye flour, 250g (9 oz)/5 whole eggs,beaten, 100g (3½ oz) sugar, 195g (6¾ oz) unsalted butter, 475g (1lb ½ oz) dark chocolate, at least 66% cocoa solids, 77g (3 oz) sugar, 265g (9¼ oz) dark brown sugar, 70g (2¾ oz) good quality cocoa powder, 5g (⅛ oz) vanilla extract, 3g (⅛ oz) baking soda, 2g (⅛ oz) sea salt, plus extra for sprinkling (optional)

Cooking instructions:
Place all the stage 1 ingredients in a 300ml (½ pint) jar or container with a lid, mix, cover and leave at warm room temperature for 4–6 hours. Place the stage 2 ingredients plus 125g (4 oz) of the starter in a large bowl, stir well with a whisk, cover and leave in a warm place for 1–2 hours or more time if it suits you. It won’t rise much but you should see some bubbles as evidence of fermentation on the surface of the mix. In the hour before you plan to do the final mix and bake, melt the butter and chocolate in a small heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Set aside to cool for 30 minutes. Line a 25cm (10 in) square tin with baking parchment. Preheat the oven to 160ºC/325ºF/gas mark 3. Add the melted chocolate and butter plus the remaining stage 3 ingredients into the bowl with the batter. Whisk until well combined. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top with the back of a spoon so it is evenly distributed. Bake for 30-40 minutes until the top looks dry but it still has a slight wobble. It’s difficult to overbake these. Sprinkle with additional sea salt, if liked, after they come out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin. When cool cut into squares to serve. The brownies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.

Recipe: Apple-Honey-Pecan Muffins
Category: other
Complexity: 16 ingredients, 29 steps

Ingredients needed:
Nonstick vegetable oil spray, 2 medium Pink Lady or Jonagold apples, ⅔ cup pecans, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 2 Tbsp. honey, Flaky sea salt, ¾ cup all-purpose flour, ½ cup spelt flour or all-purpose flour, 1½ tsp. baking powder, ¼ tsp. baking soda, ½ tsp. kosher salt, 2 large eggs, room temperature, ¾ cup granulated sugar, ¾ cup plus 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, ½ cup buttermilk, Raw sugar or granulated sugar (for sprinkling)

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Lightly coat flat top of a standard 12-cup muffin pan with nonstick spray (this will prevent muffins from gluing themselves to the pan). Line cups with double layers of muffin liners. Cut apples into quarters; remove cores. Cut each quarter into 4 wedges; set aside. Pulse pecans in a food processor until you have a fine meal with a bit of texture, like coarse sand. Heat a large skillet over medium-high, then add pecans and toast, stirring, until darkened and very fragrant (it’s okay if they’re even a tiny bit burnt in spots), about 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and let cool slightly. Wipe out skillet and return to medium-high heat. Melt butter, swirling pan so that it’s evenly coated, until foaming, then add reserved apples. Drizzle with honey and generously sprinkle with sea salt. Cook, tossing often, until apples are tender and deep golden brown and glazed with honey, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a medium bowl and let cool. Add all-purpose flour, spelt flour, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt to nuts; whisk to combine. Beat eggs and granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on high speed until mixture is thick, pale, and tripled in volume, 8–10 minutes. Combine oil and buttermilk in a measuring glass. With motor running, gradually pour into egg mixture, stopping as soon as incorporated to prevent eggs from deflating. Scrape into bowl with dry ingredients and fold until just combined (be careful not to overmix). Scoop about 2 Tbsp. batter into each muffin cup and place an apple slice on top. Divide remaining batter among muffin cups, filling until just below the top (you may have a spoonful or two of batter left over). Place 1 apple slice on top of each, then spoon any glaze left in the bowl on top. (You’ll have a few leftover apple slices; eat them.) Sprinkle each muffin with some raw sugar and a pinch of sea salt. Bake muffins until golden brown all over, rotating pan halfway through, 22–28 minutes. Let cool in pan 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. Do Ahead: Batter can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.

Morton kosher salt, 3 serrano chiles, halved, 6 oz. ginger, peeled, coarsely chopped (about ½ cup), 1 cup (lightly packed) grated jaggery, 6 Tbsp. fresh lime juice, 2 tsp. red chile powder, preferably Kashmiri, 1 tsp. ground turmeric, 2 cups basmati rice, 9 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided, 6 curry leaves, 3 dried Kashmiri, guajillo, or New Mexico chiles, seeds removed, 1 Tbsp. brown mustard seeds, 1 tsp. asafetida, ½ tsp. fenugreek

Cooking instructions:
Bring tomato, toor dal, salt, and 8 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, skimming foam from surface and stirring occasionally, 8–10 minutes. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring and skimming occasionally, until dal are very soft but not disintegrated, 45–60 minutes. Meanwhile, process chiles and ginger in a food processor to a coarse purée, about 1 minute. Transfer to a 2-cup measuring glass or a medium bowl; stir in jaggery, lime juice, chile powder, and turmeric. Set seasoning mixture aside. Once dal is done, mix in reserved seasoning mixture and simmer until flavors are melded, about 5 minutes. Blend dal with an immersion blender or in a blender until smooth; it should be about the consistency of heavy cream. Do Ahead: Dal can be made 3–4 hours ahead. Cover and keep warm. While the dal is cooking, place rice in a medium bowl and cover with cold water. Swish around with your fingers to remove surface starches, then drain through a sieve or colander. Repeat process until water runs clear, about 4 or 5 changes of water. Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium pot over medium. Add rice and stir to coat grains in oil. Add 4 cups water and bring to a boil over high; reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Just before serving, heat remaining 7 Tbsp. oil in a small skillet over medium-high. Add curry leaves, chiles, mustard seeds, asafetida, and fenugreek one at a time, pausing for a second between each addition and swirling pan. Cook until spices are toasted and curry leaves sizzle and pop, about 20 seconds. Spoon spices over dal; serve with rice.

10 1/2 oz. butternut squash, peeled and cut into rough 3/4-inch cubes, 18 oz. parsnips, cut into rough 3/4-inch cubes, 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling, 1 tsp. fennel seeds, ground, 1 tsp. cumin seeds, ground, 1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, 3 1/2 oz. sprouted lentils (store-bought or sprouted at home), 3 1/2 oz. arugula, 2 oz. full-fat Greek yogurt, to serve (optional), 5 1/2 oz. spelt flour, plus extra for dusting, 1/3 cup tepid water, 1 Tbsp. olive oil, Generous pinch of salt and pepper, 1/4 tsp. ground coriander

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Put the cubed butternut squash and parsnips in a baking tray, drizzle with the oil, and scatter the spices on top, tossing to thoroughly coat the vegetables in the spiced oil. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes, tossing them once halfway through and adding the sprouted lentils after 15 minutes, until the vegetables are golden. In the meantime, make the flatbreads. Mix the flour with the water, oil, and spices in a bowl. Knead until the dough comes together and is smooth and not sticky, adding more water if necessary, then separate the dough into 4 small balls. Dust the work surface with flour, and roll out the balls of dough using a floured rolling pin (or wine bottle) until you have breads about 8 inches in diameter. Heat a large, dry frying pan over high heat, then cook each flatbread for 1–2 minutes on each side until lightly browned. When the vegetables are cooked, remove the tray from the oven, and fold the arugula into the root vegetables. This will gently wilt the leaves. Build your flatbreads, drizzling with a little olive oil or yogurt on top if you like.

Recipe: Extra-Flaky Pastry Dough
Category: other
Complexity: 4 ingredients, 25 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 1/2 tsp. sugar, 3/4 tsp. kosher salt, 1 1/3 cups (180 g) all-purpose flour, plus more for surface, 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter

Cooking instructions:
Whisk sugar, salt, and 1 1/3 cups flour in a medium bowl. Cut butter into 6 rectangular pieces (if using 1/2-cup sticks, cut them in half crosswise, then in half again lengthwise). Toss butter in dry ingredients to coat, then dump mixture out onto a work surface. Roll butter into flour until it is in long flexible strips, using a bench scraper to scrape butter off rolling pin or surface as needed. Use bench scraper to gather mixture into a loose pile, then drizzle 4 Tbsp. ice water over. Using your hands and the bench scraper, toss mixture until water is distributed, then gather into a rectangular pile. Roll out dough to a long rectangle with short ends about 8" wide, then use bench scraper to fold dough into thirds, like folding a letter. It will be very crumbly and loose; don’t panic. Using bench scraper to help, turn rectangle 90° and repeat rolling and folding, gathering loose bits of dough from outer edges into the center and flouring surface as needed. Repeat rolling and folding a third time. Dough should be somewhat homogenous and creamy-looking with some dry bits around edges. Squeeze a bit in your palm; it should loosely hold together. If not, repeat rolling and folding. Wrap folded dough in plastic, then press it into a compact disk about 1" thick. Chill 30 minutes. Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12"–14" round or oval about 1/8" thick (don’t worry about cracks around perimeter). Dust surface and rolling pin with flour as needed and rotate dough often to prevent wider cracks. If dough sticks to surface, lift on one side and scatter flour underneath before continuing. Roll dough onto your pin, then unfurl it on a sheet of parchment paper. Slide onto a rimmed baking sheet and chill while you prep the filling. Do Ahead: Dough can be made 3 days ahead. Keep chilled, or transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling out.

Recipe: Sweet Potato Breakfast Bowls
Category: other
Complexity: 9 ingredients, 16 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 lbs. sweet potatoes, scrubbed, 8 oz. bacon, baked, 2 Tbsp. coconut milk, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, Pinch of sea salt, 2 Tbsp. collagen powder, optional, 1 pint fresh blueberries, 1 ripe banana, sliced, 1/4 cup chopped almonds

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the sweet potatoes on the sheet and roast them for about 45 minutes, or until they’re quite soft and a knife easily pierces through the flesh. Remove them from the oven, slice them open, and allow them to cool for a few minutes. About 30 minutes into the roasting of the sweet potatoes, start baking the bacon. Once the bacon is cool, roughly chop it, then set it aside. To make the sweet potato purée, I find it easiest to cut the ends off the sweet potatoes, then peel the skin off. Place the roasted flesh into a food processor, then add the coconut milk, vanilla, salt, and, if desired, collagen powder. Purée for about 30 seconds, or until the mixture is smooth. If it’s too thick, add a splash more of the coconut milk and process again. If you don’t have a food processor, combine everything in a large bowl and stir it very well with a wooden spoon. Divide the sweet potato purée between serving bowls. Top it with the chopped bacon, blueberries, sliced banana, and chopped almonds, and serve. The bowls can be assembled ahead of time, but it’s best to leave the fruit off until they’re ready to eat. They can be eaten cold or gently reheated.

Recipe: Crazy Sesame Breadsticks
Category: other
Complexity: 8 ingredients, 17 steps

Ingredients needed:
1/2 cup warm water (105–115°F), 1 tsp active dry yeast, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp olive oil, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 1 to 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 3 Tbsp white sesame seeds (not toasted), 3 Tbsp black sesame seeds (not toasted; see Cooks’ Note, below)

Cooking instructions:
Stir together water, yeast, and sugar in a medium bowl, and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (If mixture doesn’t foam, start over with new yeast.) Add oil, salt, and 1 cup flour and stir until a dough forms (it should be soft but not sticky), adding more flour a little at a time, if necessary. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding just enough flour to surface to keep dough from sticking, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled, about 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400°F with racks in upper and lower thirds. Oil 2 large baking sheets. Punch down dough, then roll out on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch square. Lightly brush dough with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds, pressing to help them adhere. Cut dough into very thin strips (about 1/4-inch wide) with a pizza wheel or sharp knife. Divide strips between baking sheets, scattering them loosely in a free-form pattern (strips may overlap). Bake, switching position of sheets halfway through, until crisp and golden-brown in spots, 10 to 15 minutes (if breadsticks begin to get too dark in spots, cover area with foil.) Transfer to racks to cool, about 10 minutes. Breadsticks can be made up to 1 week ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature. Reheat if desired before serving.

Cooking instructions:
Melt chocolate with Nutella and keep warm. Beat cream with an electric mixer until it just holds soft peaks, then chill. Beat egg and yolks in cleaned mixer bowl with cleaned beaters at high speed until thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, bring sugar, water, and corn syrup to a boil in a 1-qt heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally until sugar has dissolved. Continue to boil, undisturbed, until candy thermometer registers 238°F (soft-ball stage; you will need to tilt pan to get temperature), about 4 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium and add hot sugar mixture to eggs in a slow steam (try to avoid beaters and side of bowl), then beat until mixture is pale, thick, tripled in volume, and completely cool, about 5 minutes. Fold chocolate mixture into egg mixture. Fold in one third of whipped cream to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream gently but thoroughly. Chill at least 4 hours. Line a baking pan with foil (shiny side up). Heat sugar in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring with a fork to heat sugar evenly, until it starts to melt, then stop stirring and cook, swirling skillet occasionally so sugar melts evenly, until it is dark amber. Add hazelnuts, stirring until coated. Transfer to foil and cool completely, then coarsely chop. Preheat oven to 400°F with rack in middle. Line a large heavy baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out puff pastry onto a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 17- by 10-inch rectangle (about 1/8 inch thick). Transfer to baking sheet, then cover with a sheet of parchment and top with a heavy baking sheet or sheet pan to weight down. Bake until pale golden, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together corn syrup and water. Remove top baking sheet and parchment. Generously brush pastry with corn syrup mixture and cover with parchment, then invert pastry and brush other side with corn syrup mixture. Replace parchment and baking sheet and bake until deep golden and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes more. Cool completely. Using a serrated knife, trim edges of pastry, then halve lengthwise and cut each half into 8 equal rectangles for a total of 16 rectangles. Arrange 8 rectangles on a baking sheet and dust with confectioners’ sugar to cover. (To mark pastry decoratively, see cooks’ note, below.) Dab a small amount of hazelnut crème in center of 8 plates, then put an undecorated pastry rectangle on top. Divide remaining hazelnut crème among pastry rectangles. Sprinkle with some of the candied hazelnuts and top with decorated pastry rectangles. Sprinkle with more candied hazelnuts. Hazelnut crème can be chilled up to 2 days. Candied hazelnuts keep in an airtight container 3 weeks. Pastry can be baked 2 days ahead and kept in an airtight container at room temperature.

Recipe: Sweet Potato Toasts with Toppings
Category: other
Complexity: 3 ingredients, 5 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 large sweet potato, scrubbed (peel if desired, but it’s not necessary), Toppings of choice (I like almond butter and berries for a sweeter version or avocado and an egg for a savory twist), Pinch of sea salt

Cooking instructions:
Cut the sweet potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices. Toast it in a toaster (you will probably need two cycles) or in a toaster oven for about 10 minutes, until the potato has cooked through and is golden brown around the edges. Add the toppings of your choice and sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt. Get creative! Store any unused “toast” in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheat before serving.

Recipe: Shortcut Puff Pastry
Category: other
Complexity: 4 ingredients, 20 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 Tbsp. sugar, 1½ tsp. kosher salt, 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for surface, 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter

Cooking instructions:
Whisk sugar, salt, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a large bowl to combine. Grate 1/2 cup butter on the large holes of a box grater directly into bowl (work quickly so the butter doesn’t soften too much in your hands). Thinly slice remaining 3/4 cup butter and add to bowl. Toss to coat butter, then quickly smash slices with your fingers into smaller, flatter pieces. Gradually drizzle in 7 Tbsp. ice water, tossing constantly with a fork to distribute. Using your hands, knead dough a couple of times in bowl to bring together in large clumps. Transfer clumps to a piece of plastic wrap, leaving dry bits behind. Toss dry bits in bowl, drizzling in more ice water by the teaspoonful as needed, until they hold together when squeezed in your hand (it will be very dry, which is normal). Add to dough on plastic and wrap tightly, forming into a 6" square. Flatten, pushing dough into corners and pressing out any air pockets. Chill 2 hours. Let dough sit at room temperature about 4 minutes to soften. Roll out on a lightly floured surface into a long rectangle about 1/4" thick. Fold into thirds like a letter and rotate 90°F. Repeat rolling and folding process, dusting with more flour as needed. Rewrap tightly and chill at least 30 minutes before using. Dough can be made 2 days ahead. Keep chilled.
