Recipe: Instant Pot Lemon Vanilla Rice Pudding With Whipped Cream
Category: pudding
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 13 steps

Ingredients needed:
2/3 cup Arborio or other short-grain white rice, 3 cups whole milk, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 cinnamon stick, 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest, Pinch of kosher salt, 1/2 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise, 3/4 cup heavy cream, 2 egg yolks, 1/2 cup raisins (optional), Ground cinnamon, for serving (optional), Whipped cream, for serving (optional)

Cooking instructions:
In the pressure cooker pot, stir together the rice, milk, sugar, cinnamon stick, lemon zest, and salt. Use the tip of a paring knife to scrape the vanilla seeds out of the pod into the pot and add the vanilla bean, too. Lock the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 4 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then manually release the remaining pressure. Remove and discard the cinnamon stick and vanilla bean. In a small bowl, whisk together the cream and yolks. Whisk into the rice, continuing to stir until thickened, 2 to 4 minutes. The residual heat of the rice will cook the yolks. Stir in the raisins (if using). Spoon the pudding into serving bowls, then cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours. The pudding will thicken as it cools. Serve with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon and whipped cream, if desired.
