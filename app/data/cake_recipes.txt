Recipe: Chhena Poda (Spiced Cheesecake)
Category: cake
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 18 steps

Ingredients needed:
Ghee, for the cake pan, 8 ounces paneer, preferably homemade, ¼ cup confectioners’ sugar, ½ teaspoon ground cardamom, 2 tablespoons semolina, 1½ tablespoons ghee, store-bought or homemade, ¼ cup whole milk, 2 tablespoons roasted cashews, 2 tablespoons golden raisins, 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, Freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds (optional), for serving

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch nonstick metal cake pan with some ghee. In a large bowl, stir together the paneer, confectioners’ sugar, and cardamom until incorporated but still slightly chunky. Add the semolina, ghee, and milk and whisk until smooth. Stir in the cashews and raisins and set aside. Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the bottom of the prepared cake pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium heat and once the sugar just begins to bubble and turn pale golden brown (the sugar will continue to caramelize in the oven, so don’t let it get any darker right now), after 8 to 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat using tongs. (This step is a bit tricky and you might be tempted to move the sugar around with a spoon while it is bubbling, but don’t touch it—just let it caramelize on its own.) You will know it’s ready for the cake batter when it’s bubbling but is still slightly grainy and just turning a pale golden color. Pour the batter into the pan, using a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl clean. It should settle into an even layer on its own, but if it doesn’t, use the spatula to create a smooth surface. Wearing oven mitts, carefully transfer the pan to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool in the pan to room temperature. Run a paring knife around the cake’s edges and then place a serving platter larger than the diameter of the cake over the cake and gently flip the cake over—it should slide out, with caramel coming out with it like you would see in a flan (though some caramel will be left in the pan—this is fine). Slice and serve with freshly whipped cream or sliced almonds, if desired. The cake will keep in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Note: To clean the pan, add some boiling water to the pan and let it sit for at least 30 minutes to loosen up the browned sugar sticking to the surface of the pan before cleaning it.

Recipe: Double Ripple Ice Cream Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 17 ingredients, 43 steps

Ingredients needed:
8 oz. red or black plums (2��3), pitted, chopped, 3 Tbsp. light brown sugar, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, ¾ cup (96 g) walnuts, ¼ cup (35 g) black and/or white sesame seeds, 1 cup pure maple syrup, preferably grade B, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for pan, ¾ cup (packed; 150 g) light brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. tahini, 2 tsp. vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, ¾ tsp. kosher salt, 1 chilled large egg, 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, ¾ tsp. baking powder, 5 pints high-quality vanilla ice cream, divided, A 9" springform pan

Cooking instructions:
Bring plums, brown sugar, and salt to a boil in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until fruit is softened and juices deepen in color, about 8 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl, pushing plum flesh through; discard skins. Return sauce to pan and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook, still stirring, until reduced to about ⅔ cup, about 3 minutes. Pour ripple into a jar and let cool, then cover and chill 1 hour before using. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Place walnuts on 1 side of a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt. Toast, tossing halfway through, 8 minutes (nuts should not be quiet golden brown yet). Remove from oven and add sesame seeds on empty side of baking sheet. Toast until nuts and seeds are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Let cool; chop nuts. Combine nuts, sesame seeds, maple syrup, and salt in a small jar or bowl and stir well. Cover and set aside. Lightly butter pan and line with a parchment paper round. Heat brown sugar, tahini, and remaining ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter until bubbling in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat, stirring until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, 1 minute. Let cool slightly. Stir vanilla bean paste and salt followed by egg into brown sugar mixture. Sift flour and baking powder through a fine-mesh sieve into mixture and fold to barely combine. Scrape batter into the prepared pan. Bake until golden around the edges, evenly tan across the top, and puffed in the center, about 20 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let blondie base cool. Run a knife around the sides to help base release but keep springform pan intact, then cover and chill in freezer at least 15 minutes or until ready to use. Cut 3 pints of ice cream out of their containers and place in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, you can beat in a large bowl with a wooden spoon or stiff rubber spatula until the consistency of cake batter.) Mix on low speed 2 minutes, then working up to medium speed, beat until barely pliable. It will soften further as it sits, but you want it to be sticky and slightly challenging to spread when you assemble cake. Chill in the freezer at any point if it becomes too soft and melted. Remove blondie base and remaining 2 still-frozen pints of ice cream from freezer. Using an offset spatula, spread a third of softened ice cream over base. Using a spring-loaded ice cream scoop, scoop out and place mounds of 1-pint still-frozen ice cream on top in a random manner. Dollop one third of maple ripple over ice cream, avoiding edges of pan. Next, drizzle one third of plum ripple over ice cream, creating stripes. Repeat layering process, using half of remaining softened ice cream, all of remaining frozen ice cream, half of remaining maple ripple, and half of remaining plum ripple. Top with a final layer of remaining softened ice cream, smooth surface, then drizzle with remaining maple ripple and plum ripple. (If at any point the ice cream gets so soft that you can’t achieve distinct layers, chill in freezer for a few minutes.) Freeze, uncovered, 2 hours, then cover and freeze at least 8 hours before serving. To serve, run a knife or offset spatula around edge of pan to release. Unmold and remove parchment paper; discard. Transfer cake to a platter, smooth sides with an offset spatula, and freeze 10 minutes. Slice with a warm knife, wiping off between cuts.

Recipe: Bibingkang Cassava (Cassava Cake)
Category: cake
Complexity: 7 ingredients, 13 steps

Ingredients needed:
4 egg yolks, beaten, One 1-lb (500 g) package frozen grated cassava, thawed, 1 cup (250 g) jarred macapuno coconut strings, or sweetened shredded coconut, 1½ cups (375 ml) canned unsweetened coconut milk, ½ cup (125 ml) sweetened condensed milk, 4 egg whites, ¼ cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. To make the cake, combine the egg yolks, cassava, macapuno (or shredded coconut, if using), coconut milk and the ½ cup sweetened condensed milk in a large bowl and mix well. Pour the cake batter into a greased 8 x 8-in (20 x 20-cm) cake pan. The cake batter will appear to be very loose and wet at this point, but don’t worry, the cassava will absorb most of the liquid during baking. Place the cake pan into the oven and bake until the top of the cake appears dry and no liquid is floating on the surface, 45–60 minutes. Meanwhile, to make the topping, whisk together the egg whites and the ¼ cup (65 ml) sweetened condensed milk in a medium bowl until very well incorporated. Although you are using egg whites, don’t be concerned with making a foam or a meringue, just mix until combined. Remove the cake from the oven and evenly pour the topping onto the cake. Return the cake to the oven and bake until the topping sets, about 10 minutes more. Remove the cake from the oven and rest the cake in its pan on a cooling rack. Cool the cake completely before cutting it into squares. The cassava cake can be served at room temperature, or cold out of the refrigerator.

Recipe: Very Red Velvet Cake With Cream Cheese Icing and Pecans
Category: cake
Complexity: 13 ingredients, 20 steps

Ingredients needed:
2½ cups cake flour, ½ teaspoon baking soda, 2 large eggs, at room temperature, 1½ cups sugar, 1½ cups vegetable oil, 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar, 1 cup buttermilk, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 3 tablespoons red food coloring (from two 1-ounce bottles), 1 (1-pound) box confectioners’ sugar, sifted, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, softened, 1 cup chopped pecans

Cooking instructions:
To make the cake: Set the oven to 350°F and adjust the rack positions to the middle and top third. Spray three 8-inch round cake pans well with baking spray. Sift the flour with the baking soda. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, oil, and vinegar. On low speed, slowly add the flour and beat in well. Add the buttermilk slowly, then the vanilla, and then the food coloring. Pour the batter evenly into the pans and rap them on the countertop several times to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pans from shelf to shelf so they bake evenly and bake until the tops spring back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes altogether. Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes. Run a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they’re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier. To make the icing: Combine everything in a medium bowl and mix well until very smooth. It’s best to use the icing right away, when it’s soft and spreadable. Put one cake layer upside down on a cake plate or cake stand and cover the top evenly with frosting. Add a second layer, right side up, and spread with more frosting. Top with the third layer, right side up, and spread the frosting evenly around the sides of the cake and on top; check for any places where you can see through to the cake. Finally, sprinkle the pecans evenly all over the top of the cake. Once the frosting sets, cut into slices to serve. This cake keeps for up to 2 weeks in a cake keeper, but once it’s ready, people want to dive right in.

Recipe: Strawberry Balsamic Shortcakes
Category: cake
Complexity: 14 ingredients, 21 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 cups (400 g) hulled and coined strawberries, 2 tbsp (24 g) pure cane sugar, 3 cups (360 g) whole wheat pastry flour, plus more for dusting, 4 tsp (10 g) baking powder, 3 tbsp (36 g) granulated sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, ½ cup (120 ml) olive oil, ½ cup (120 ml) buttermilk, plus more for brushing, Raw sugar, for sprinkling (optional), ½ cup (120 ml) balsamic vinegar, ¼ cup (60 ml) agave or honey, 1 cup (235 ml) cold heavy cream, 3 tbsp (45 ml) honey or agave, Mint or basil for topping

Cooking instructions:
To make the strawberries, toss the coined berries and cane sugar together in a bowl. Let them sit for about 20 minutes, or until they start to break down and liquefy. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C or gas mark 8) and have a sheet pan lined with parchment nearby. To make the biscuits, in a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, granulated sugar and salt. Drizzle over the olive oil, and gently toss with your hands until droplets of oil are dispersed evenly throughout the flour. Add the buttermilk, stirring gently and compressing with your hands until a shaggy dough is formed. Dump out onto a floured work surface and knead until it comes together into a solid mass. Roll it out into a 1¼-inch (3-cm)-thick disk. Using a 3-inch (7.5-cm) biscuit cutter, punch out 6 biscuits, folding and re-rolling the dough if needed. Place the biscuits on the lined sheet tray, brush with more buttermilk, sprinkle with raw sugar if using, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until slightly puffed and golden brown. Remove the biscuits and transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make the balsamic glaze, combine the balsamic vinegar and honey in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer. Cook over medium-low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid reduces by half. Set aside to cool and thicken. To make the whipped cream topping, when you’re ready to serve, beat together the cream and honey in a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, or in a bowl with an electric mixer, until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Split the cooled biscuits in half and spoon on some of the strawberries along with some of their juices so it soaks into the bottom biscuit. Top with a dollop of whipped cream, followed by a drizzle of the balsamic glaze. Top with the other half of the biscuit, and repeat with more strawberries, more cream, and another drizzle of glaze. Repeat with the rest of the biscuits, and serve immediately.

Recipe: Strawberry Coconut Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 19 ingredients, 33 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 cups granulated sugar, ¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, 2 cups fresh strawberries, hulled, 3 large eggs, room temperature, 3 cups sifted all-purpose flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, ¾ cup sour cream, room temperature, ⅓ cup vegetable oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon strawberry extract, 3–4 drops red food coloring (optional), 2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature, ¾ cup confectioners’ sugar, 1 cup heavy cream, cold, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon coconut extract (optional), Pinch salt, ¾ cup sweetened coconut flakes, for garnish

Cooking instructions:
Preheat your oven to 350°F. Liberally prepare 3 9-inch round pans with the nonstick method of your choice. In the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, cream together the granulated sugar and butter on medium-high speed until nice and fluffy, about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, place the strawberries in your food processor and purée until smooth. Set aside. With your stand mixer running, add the eggs 1 at a time, combining well after each addition and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Change your mixer speed to medium-low and add the strawberry purée slowly into the batter. Continue mixing while you tend to the dry ingredients. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Slowly add ½ of the flour mixture to your stand mixer bowl. Continue to mix on low speed to combine. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and oil and add to your stand mixer bowl. Pour in the remaining flour mixture and continue to mix on low until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract, strawberry extract, and food coloring, if using. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix the batter until just combined. Be careful not to overmix. Evenly pour the batter into the prepared pans and bake for 23 to 28 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a layer comes out clean. Let the layers cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then invert onto wire racks. Let cool to room temperature. Lightly cover the layers with foil or plastic wrap so they do not dry out. Clean your stand mixer bowl and whisk attachment. Beat the cream cheese on high speed until it begins to thicken and become fluffy. Turn your mixer down to low speed and carefully add the confectioners’ sugar. Once the sugar is fully incorporated, turn your mixer speed back to high and continue whipping. Add the heavy cream; vanilla extract; coconut extract, if using; and salt and continue to mix until a smooth, light, and fluffy frosting is achieved. Once the layers are completely cooled, place 1 layer on a serving plate. Spread just the top of the layer with ⅓ of the frosting. Add the second layer and spread with another ⅓ of the frosting. Add the final layer, bottom-side up, and spread with the remaining frosting. Frost the top and the side of the cake. Gently pat the side and the top of the cake with coconut flakes. Serve at room temperature.

Recipe: Roasted Strawberry Layer Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 17 ingredients, 50 steps

Ingredients needed:
Scant 2 cups (230 g) all-purpose flour, 2½ tsp (11 g) baking powder, 3 tbsp (45 ml) milk, 2 tbsp (30 ml) elderflower cordial, 1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter, 1 cup plus 2 tbsp (230 g) superfine/caster sugar, Zest of 1 lemon, 4 eggs, Approximately 1 lb (400–450 g) fresh strawberries, ¼ cup (50 g) superfine/caster sugar, 2 tsp (10 g) vanilla bean paste, ½ cup plus 1 tbsp (150 g) egg whites, 1 cup (200 g) superfine/caster sugar, 1⅓ cups (300 g) unsalted butter, softened, 6 tbsp (90 ml) elderflower cordial, Fresh strawberries, to decorate, Fresh elderflower, to decorate

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease the base and sides of three deep, round 6-inch (15-cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper. To make the cake, sift together the flour and baking powder in a large bowl, and set aside. Mix the milk and elderflower cordial in a small bowl and set aside. Using a stand mixer or electric whisk, beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest for 5 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. If the mixture looks like it’s starting to curdle, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of the flour mixture. Turn the mixer speed to low and add half of the flour mixture followed by the milk and elderflower. Stir in the remaining flour and divide the batter equally into the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 35 to 37 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cakes cool in their pans for 10 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. Once cool, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge to firm up. To make the purée, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Slice the stems off the strawberries, cut them in half and put them into a baking dish. Toss the fruit with the sugar and vanilla. Roast the strawberries in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once halfway. The strawberries are done once they are soft and fragrant and the juices have turned into a syrup. Leave the strawberries to cool completely before transferring them to a food processor or blender and pulsing until smooth. Store in an airtight container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it. To make the buttercream, add the egg whites and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer or a heatproof bowl. Make sure there are no traces of grease in the bowl as this will stop the meringue from whipping up. Place the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the base doesn’t touch the water. Whisk the eggs and sugar constantly until the mixture reaches a temperature of about 150°F (65°C). If you don’t have a thermometer, rub a little of the mixture in between your fingers. The eggs should be hot to the touch with all the sugar dissolved. Remove the bowl from the heat and start whisking the egg whites on high speed in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or with an electric whisk. Beat until the whites are thick and have doubled in volume. Once the bowl is cool to the touch and with the mixer still running, add the butter a piece at a time. The meringue will deflate and will start to look a little runny or curdled. Don’t panic—this is normal. Continue beating until you have added in all of the butter and the mixture is smooth and glossy. If after 10 minutes, your meringue buttercream is still soupy, chill it in the fridge for 20 minutes and then beat again. Add about 1/2 cup (125 g) of the strawberry puree and beat the buttercream for 2 minutes, or until smooth. Leave the buttercream at room temperature until you are ready to assemble. Unwrap the cakes from the fridge and if any of them are domed, level them with a serrated knife or a cake leveler. All the layers need to be completely flat to ensure you don’t end up with a wonky cake. Brush each cake layer with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of elderflower cordial. Place one layer of cake on a cake board and put this board on a turntable, if using. If your buttercream has firmed up, whip it up again in the mixer until smooth. Add a scoop of buttercream and spread it out evenly with an offset spatula, pushing the buttercream right to the edge (it’s fine if it spills over). Place the next layer on top of the first, but this time add about 1 tablespoon (8 g) of strawberry purée on top of the buttercream layer, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) clear around the edge. Place the last layer topside down to give you a perfectly flat top. Frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of buttercream. Smooth the edges as much as you can with a bench scraper or palette knife. This is the crumb coat layer that will trap any stray crumbs and act as a base for the next layer. Place the cake in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up before adding another layer of buttercream on the top and sides. Fill a piping bag fitted with an open star nozzle (I’ve used Wilton 8B) with any remaining buttercream and pipe swirls across the edge to make a wreath. Top the cake with fresh strawberries, a drizzle of any leftover puree and fresh elderflower (if in season).

Recipe: Win Son Bakery's Red Date Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 14 ingredients, 24 steps

Ingredients needed:
6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan, 6 oz. pitted dried red dates, coarsely chopped (about 2 cups), ½ tsp. baking soda, 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar, ½ tsp. vanilla extract, 2 large eggs, 4 whole pitted dried red dates, ¼ cup heavy cream, 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar, ½ tsp. kosher salt

Cooking instructions:
A 9"-diameter springform pan Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter pan; set aside. Bring dates, baking soda, and ¾ cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Let cool. Sift flour into a medium bowl; mix in baking powder and salt. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat granulated sugar, vanilla, and remaining 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition; beat until mixture is very light and airy, about 3 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and beat just until incorporated. Mix in cooled date mixture, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat until just combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface to make an even layer. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25–30 minutes. While the cake bakes, make the glaze. Slice each date in half lengthwise, then thinly slice each half into strips. Place in a small bowl and pour in ½ cup boiling water to cover; let soak. Cook cream, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up sugar as needed, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Bring just to a simmer and cook, stirring, until glaze thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Let cool until glaze thickens further but is still pourable, about 15 minutes. Remove cake from springform pan and slide onto a platter or large plate. Arrange drained date strips along edge of cake so they look like spokes on a wheel. Carefully drizzle warm glaze over cake, so it drips over the edges. Let cool completely before serving.

Recipe: Mochi Cake, Any Way You Want It
Category: cake
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 20 steps

Ingredients needed:
6 Tbsp. unsalted butter or virgin coconut oil, melted, plus more for pan, 1½ cups (300 g) sugar, plus more for pan, 1 (13.5-oz.) can unsweetened coconut milk or 1⅔ cups half-and-half, 2 large eggs, 2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 2 cups (254 g) glutinous sweet rice flour, preferably Koda Farms Blue Star Mochiko, 3 Tbsp. powdered flavoring of choice (such as unsweetened cocoa powder, pandan leaf powder, or malted milk powder) or 1 Tbsp. matcha powder plus 2 Tbsp. glutinous sweet rice flour or 3 Tbsp. glutinous sweet rice flour, 1 tsp. ground spice of choice (such as cinnamon, cardamom, or turmeric), 1 tsp. baking powder, ¼–⅓ cup unsweetened shredded coconut or sesame seeds

Cooking instructions:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter a 9"-diameter cake pan or an 8x8" baking pan or 14 cups of two standard 12-cup muffin pans. (If you only have 1 muffin pan, you can bake the extra batter in a small loaf pan or mini muffin pan, or just discard it.) Generously coat pan with sugar, tapping out excess (about ¼ cup should do it). Place 1½ cups (300 g) sugar and 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl. If using coconut milk, heat in a small saucepan over medium, whisking constantly, until no clumps remain, then whisk into sugar mixture. If using half-and-half, whisk directly into sugar mixture. Add eggs, vanilla, and salt and whisk to combine. Whisk rice flour, powdered flavoring of choice (or 3 Tbsp. more rice flour), spice of choice, and baking powder in a medium bowl to combine, then whisk into egg mixture. Scrape batter into prepared pan and sprinkle with coconut or sesame seeds. Bake until top begins to crack and cake springs back when gently pressed, 55–65 minutes for cake and 45–55 minutes for cupcakes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Run a knife around perimeter of cake, place a plate over pan, and invert cake onto plate. Hold wire rack over cake and invert cake onto rack (simply turn cupcakes out onto rack and turn over). Let cool completely. Do ahead: Cake can be baked 5 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Recipe: Orange Chocolate Loaf Cake From Florida
Category: cake
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 20 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process), 1 cup sugar, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 large eggs, Finely grated zest of 1 large, deep-colored orange, 1/3 cup orange juice, 3 tablespoons sugar

Cooking instructions:
Adjust rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. You will need a loaf pan measuring about 8½ x 4½ x 2¾ inches, or one with about a 6‑cup capacity. Butter the pan and dust it all over lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs, shake out excess crumbs, and set the pan aside. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa, and sugar and set aside. Beat the cream and vanilla in the small bowl of an electric mixer until the cream holds a definite shape. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until the egg is incorporated after each addition. (The eggs will thin the cream slightly.) Transfer to the large bowl of the mixer and gradually, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl and beating only until smooth. Remove from the mixer and stir in the grated zest. That’s all there is to it. Turn the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly pressed with a fingertip. As soon as the cake goes into the oven, mix the orange juice with the sugar and let it stand while the cake is baking. After you remove the cake from the oven, let it cool for 5 minutes. Then, a little at a time, brush the orange juice/sugar mixture all over the cake; encourage most of it to run down the sides between the cake and the pan, but thoroughly wet the top also. The cake will absorb it all. Let the cake stand in the pan until it is completely cool. Then cover the pan loosely with a piece of wax paper. Invert the cake into the palm of your hand—easy does it—remove the pan, cover the cake with a rack, and invert again, leaving the cake right side up.

2 1/4 cups cake flour or 2 cups all purpose flour, sifted (measured by sifting into the cup and leveling it off), 2 teaspoons baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold, 3 large eggs, at room temperature, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons superfine sugar, Special Equipment: 1 (10-cup) fluted metal tube pan, coated with baking spray with flour

Cooking instructions:
Twenty minutes or more before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F (350°F if using a dark pan). In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt and then sift them together to make the mixture easier to incorporate. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk beater, whip the cream, starting on low speed, gradually raising the speed to medium-high as it thickens, until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla just until lightly combined. On medium-high speed, gradually beat the egg mixture into the whipped cream. The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it. Detach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. With a small metal spatula, loosen the top edges of the cake and invert the cake onto a wire rack that has been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Cool completely. The cake requires no adornment, but I love to serve it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or a large dollop of lightly sweetened Whipped Cream.

Recipe: Syrniki (Сырники / Farmer’s Cheese Pancakes)
Category: cake
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 12 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 egg yolks, 2 cups (1 pound) tvorog or farmer’s cheese, homemade or store-bought, Scant 1⁄2 cup sugar, 3⁄4 cup flour, 1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder, Pinch of salt, A tablespoon or two of heavy cream (optional), 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, Sour cream, for garnish

Cooking instructions:
In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks into the farmer’s cheese, then stir in the sugar. Mix together 1⁄2 cup of the flour, the baking powder, and the salt and add to the cheese mixture. If the mixture seems dry, add a little heavy cream. Place the butter and oil over medium-low heat in a large nonstick skillet and melt the butter. Sprinkle the remaining 1⁄4 cup flour onto a plate and dust your hands with some flour, too. With your hands or a spoon, scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the batter and set the mound on the floured plate. Use your hands to gently shape it into a round patty about 2 inches in diameter and coat it lightly on all sides with flour. Repeat with the remaining batter. Carefully transfer the patties to the pan and cook them slowly until the undersides are browned, about 3 minutes. Turn with a spatula and cook until the other sides are browned, 3 to 4 minutes more. Serve immediately, with sour cream.

Recipe: Cardamom-Pistachio Carrot Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 18 ingredients, 35 steps

Ingredients needed:
Vegetable oil (for pan), 3 medium carrots, peeled, 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, 1 cup (130 g) raw pistachios, 3 large eggs, room temperature, 1 cup (packed; 200 g) dark brown sugar, ¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar, 1¾ tsp. baking powder, ¼ tsp. baking soda, 1½ tsp. ground cardamom, ½ tsp. ground cinnamon, 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 1½ cups (188 g) all-purpose flour, ½ cup carrot juice, ½ cup heavy cream, ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar, ¼ tsp. kosher salt, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Lightly coat bottom and sides of a 9"-diameter cake pan with oil. Line bottom of pan with a round of parchment paper and smooth to eliminate any air bubbles. Grate carrots on the large holes of a box grater. Measure out 2½ cups (lightly packed; 250 g); reserve remaining carrots for another use (like raita!). Set a fine-mesh sieve over a measuring glass and place next to stove. Heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add pistachios and cook, stirring often, until butter browns and nuts smell toasty, about 5 minutes. (Butter will get very foamy and it will be hard to see what’s going on, so once the foam is golden brown, remove pan from heat every 10 seconds to check how the nuts are browning.) Pour mixture through prepared sieve, scraping in all of the browned bits; set nuts and butter aside. Crack eggs into a large bowl; add brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cardamom, cinnamon, and salt. Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat 3 minutes (mixture should be thick, pale, and increased in volume). Decrease speed to medium-high and gradually stream in reserved brown butter (including browned bits); beat until combined. Coarsely chop reserved pistachios. Using a rubber spatula, fold in flour until almost completely combined, then add nuts and carrots and continue to fold until everything is incorporated. Scrape batter into prepared pan; smooth surface. Place pan on a clean smooth surface and give it a fast 360-degree spin (this pushes the batter up the sides of the pan and minimizes doming during baking). Bake cake until deeply browned and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50–55 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a small offset spatula or butter knife around perimeter of cake to loosen. Place a plate upside down over cake and invert cake onto plate (leave flat side up). Remove parchment paper. Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature. Place a small plate in the freezer. Cook carrot juice, cream, granulated sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over high heat (do not stir) until thick like lava, 8–10 minutes. Mixture will initially bubble and foam vigorously and look like it’s going to boil over, but it won’t! Don’t be tempted to reduce the heat; the bubbling will subside and mixture will thicken. You want it to be thick enough to stick to the cake, but do not let it brown. Test glaze by putting a small dollop onto the cold plate: When you run your finger through the glaze, it should leave a defined trail. Once the glaze is thick enough, remove pan from heat and stir in butter. Let cool until you can comfortably hold your finger in it (if it’s too hot, it will run right off the cake), about 15 minutes. Stir glaze well and pour over center of cake, nudging to the edges with offset spatula or butter knife. Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick. Let glaze cool at least 10 minutes before slicing cake.

Recipe: Backyard Citrus Upside-Down Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 11 ingredients, 25 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 stick (113g) unsalted butter, ½ cup (100g) plus 2 tablespoons sugar, 2 large unwaxed lemons, ends trimmed, then halved, seeded, and sliced ⅛ inch thick, 2½ cups (313g) all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder, ½ teaspoon baking soda, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, 2 large eggs, 1 cup (236ml) olive oil, 1 cup (227g) full-fat plain Greek yogurt, 1 cup (200g) sugar

Cooking instructions:
Position a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and line it with parchment paper. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter. Remove the pan from the heat and add ½ cup of the sugar and 2 tablespoons of water. Whisk the mixture until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is glossy and thickened a little. Pour the melted butter and sugar into the prepared cake pan and smooth into an even layer to cover the bottom. Place the cake pan in the freezer until the butter and sugar layer freezes; leave the pan in the freezer until you are ready to transfer the batter to the pan. In a small bowl, gently toss the lemon slices with the remaining 2 tablespoons of sugar. Leave the lemon slices in the sugar to macerate for 10 minutes. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Set aside. Combine the eggs with the olive oil in another large bowl and beat vigorously with a whisk until well combined. Add the yogurt and sugar. Make a well in the flour mixture and add the wet mixture in three additions, folding in each addition until no dry bits of flour remain. Set aside. Fan the lemon slices out to cover the melted butter and sugar in the cake pan, overlapping the slices by as much as 1⁄8 inch. Pour the cake batter directly on top of the lemon slices. Bake for about 1 hour, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs clinging to it. Transfer to a wire cooling rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Invert the cake onto a serving plate and carefully remove the parchment-paper lining. Allow the cake to cool for 1 hour more before serving. Note: This cake can be made with nearly any citrus, my favorite being lemon because I like it to be bitter and tart. The only citrus I would not use is raw grapefruit, oro blanco, or lime. The rinds of grapefruit and oro blanco are much thicker than lemons and oranges and they will take longer to bake. Lime and grapefruit also retain too much of the bitter quinine flavor and will make for an odd-tasting cake

Recipe: Sumac, Spelt, and Apple Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 15 ingredients, 17 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 large Granny Smith or Bramley apples, peeled, cored and roughly chopped, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice, 1/2 cup (120 ml) water, 1 2/3 cups (200 g) wholemeal spelt flour, Scant 1/2 cup (50 g) ground almonds, 1 Tbsp (15 g) sumac, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/4 cup (60 ml) sunflower oil, 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp (120 g) superfine/caster sugar, 1 1/2 cups (200 g) applesauce, 3 Braeburn apples, peeled, cored and diced into small chunks, 1/2 cup (60 g) confectioners’ sugar, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice, Sumac, to dust

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 1-pound (450-g) loaf pan and line with parchment paper. To make the applesauce, add the apple pieces to a saucepan with the lemon juice and water. Let them simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, or until they have completely softened. Remove from the heat and mash the apples with a fork until smooth. You will need roughly 1 1/2 cups (200 g) for this recipe. To make the cake, mix together the flour, almonds, sumac, baking powder and baking soda in a large bowl and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the oil, sugar and applesauce. Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir gently, ensuring there are no lumps of flour. The batter will be fairly thick. Mix in the chopped apples and pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool completely in the pan before turning it out. To make the drizzle, mix the sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl until it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. If it’s too thin, add some more sugar or loosen it up by adding more lemon juice. Once the cake is completely cool, use a teaspoon to drizzle the icing and sprinkle on a little more sumac.

(or more) orange juice

Cooking instructions:
Whisk pecans, spice mixture, brown sugar, flour, and salt in a small bowl to combine. Drizzle in butter and mix until clumps form. Set aside. Preheat an oven to 325°F. Lightly coat an 8½x4½" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Press paper into pan, then turn over, so greased side is facing up. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine. Beat sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium-high speed, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through, until very light and fluffy, 6–8 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. With motor running, add eggs one at a time, beating to incorporate and scraping down sides of bowl after each addition. Reduce speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and mix just to combine. Add sour cream and vanilla and beat to combine. Add remaining dry ingredients and beat until incorporated. Scrape half of batter into prepared pan. Top with streusel (yes, it will look like a lot, but use all of it!), then scrape remaining batter over. Starting at a short side of the pan and working your way to the other short side, drag a butter knife back and forth from one long side to the other through batter to marble streusel; smooth surface. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 80–90 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Run a small knife around edges of cake to loosen if needed, then, using parchment paper, lift out of pan onto rack. Peel away parchment. Let cake cool completely. Combine powdered sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl, then mix in orange juice, adding up to a teaspoonful more if needed, until you have a thick but pourable icing. Drizzle over cake and let sit until icing is set before serving, about 15 minutes. Do ahead: Cake can be baked 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Recipe: Olive Oil Apple Cake with Spiced Sugar
Category: cake
Complexity: 14 ingredients, 27 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup mild extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan, 1/2 cup plus 2 tsp. (100 g plus 10 g) granulated sugar, plus more for pan, 2 sweet apples, such as Golden Delicious or Gala, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, 1 1/2 cups (185 g) all-purpose flour, 2 tsp. baking powder, 2 large eggs, 2 egg yolks, 1/2 cup (100 g) (packed) brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp. kosher salt

Cooking instructions:

Grate apples, peel and all, on the large holes of a box grater. Gather apples in a clean kitchen towel and wring out excess liquid. Be aggressive! You want them as dry as possible when they go into the batter. Whisk cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, and ginger in a medium bowl. Transfer 1/4 tsp. spice mixture to a small bowl; set aside. Add flour and baking powder to remaining spice mixture and whisk to combine. Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl. Continue whisking vigorously until lightened in color and thickened. Whisking with one hand and pouring with the other, slowly stream 1 cup oil into egg mixture until combined. Gently fold flour mixture into whipped eggs with a flexible rubber spatula just until combined, taking care not to overmix. Fluff up grated apples and scatter over batter. Gently fold to incorporate. Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Add 2 tsp. granulated sugar to reserved spice mixture and mix to combine. Sprinkle spiced sugar evenly over top of batter. Bake cake until deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–70 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a butter knife or offset spatula along edge of cake to loosen and invert onto a platter. Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead (the flavor gets slightly more intense each day). Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Recipe: Apple-Walnut Upside-Down Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 15 ingredients, 35 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 cup raw walnuts or pecans, 10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, divided, 4 small or 3 large baking apples (such as Pink Lady), peeled, halved, cored, ½ cup (packed) light brown sugar, divided, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. kosher salt, 1 tsp. baking soda, ½ tsp. baking powder, ¼ tsp. freshly grated nutmeg, 1½ tsp. ground cinnamon, plus more for serving, ½ cup granulated sugar, 2 large eggs, room temperature, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, ½ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, room temperature, Lightly sweetened, softly whipped cream (for serving)

Cooking instructions:
Place a rack in middle of oven and preheat to 350°F. Spread out walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Let cool. Meanwhile, heat a 10" ovenproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium. Add 2 Tbsp. butter and swirl to coat; arrange apple halves cut sides down in a single layer in skillet. Cook apples, undisturbed, rotating skillet on burner as needed for even browning, until cut sides are golden brown, 5–10 minutes (the timing depends on the juiciness of the apples; juicier apples will take longer). Turn apples over and cook on rounded sides just until they start to release their juices and the tip of a knife slides through with slight resistance, about 5 minutes. Transfer apples to a plate, arrange cut sides up, and let cool. Add ¼ cup brown sugar and 1 Tbsp. water to skillet and set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon or heatproof rubber spatula until sugar is dissolved, then cook, swirling skillet occasionally (do not stir at this point), until thick and bubbling in a thin layer, about 1 minute. Let caramel cool in skillet. Meanwhile, pulse toasted walnuts, flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, nutmeg, and 1½ tsp. cinnamon in a food processor until combined and nuts are finely ground. Transfer walnut mixture to a medium bowl. Combine granulated sugar, remaining ¼ cup brown sugar, and remaining 8 Tbsp. butter in food processor (no need to wash it) and process in long pulses until mixture is light and smooth. Add eggs and vanilla and process in long pulses, scraping down sides of processor once, until mixture is smooth. Add half of walnut mixture and pulse to combine, then add yogurt and pulse just until incorporated. Add remaining walnut mixture and pulse just to combine. Arrange apple halves cut sides down over cooled caramel in skillet, spacing evenly. Fold batter a few times with spatula, scraping sides to make sure everything is well mixed. Scrape batter over apples and work into spaces around apples. Smooth surface (it’s okay if there’s only a thin layer of batter in places; it will rise in the oven). Bake cake until it is browned across the entire surface and the center springs back when gently pressed, 30–40 minutes. Let cake cool in skillet 10 minutes, then run an offset spatula or a small knife around the sides of the pan to loosen. Set a wire rack upside down on skillet and flip over to release cake; carefully remove skillet. If any apples or cake stick to skillet, scrape them off and press back onto the top of the cake. Serve cake warm or room temperature. Slice into wedges and top with dollops of whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon. Do Ahead: Cake can be baked 2 days ahead. Let cool completely. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

Recipe: Caramel Apple Cupcakes
Category: cake
Complexity: 18 ingredients, 34 steps

Ingredients needed:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt, 16 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature (European style recommended), 2 cups sugar, 4 large eggs, at room temperature, 1/3 cup hot water, 2 1/2 cups freshly grated apples (4 to 5 medium-size apples—we use Gala apples, but you can use your favorite type), 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature (European style recommended), 4 cups confectioners’ sugar, sifted, 1/4 tsp. pure vanilla extract (Nielsen-Massey pure Madagascar Bourbon recommended), 6 oz. cream cheese, at room temperature, 2 cups sugar, 1 Tbsp. water, 12 tbsp. unsalted butter, at room temperature (European style recommended), 1 tsp. pure vanilla extract (Nielsen-Massey pure Madagascar Bourbon recommended), 1 cup heavy cream, at room temperature

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a standard cupcake pan with twelve paper baking cups, and a second pan with six baking cups, or grease pans with butter if not using baking cups. Sift together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt on a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper and set aside. Place the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a bowl with a handheld electric mixer. Beat on medium speed until fluffy. Stop to add the sugar; beat on medium speed until well incorporated, approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly on medium speed, after each addition. It’s important to add them one at a time so that they will completely incorporate into the batter and you don’t put too much weight on your batter at once. This would collapse all the little air bubbles you created when you creamed the butter and sugar. Reduce the speed to low. At this stage, it’s always important to mix as slowly and as little as necessary since you don’t want to traumatize your batter. Add one third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture, then gradually add one third of the hot water, beating until well incorporated. Add another third of the flour mixture, followed by one third of the hot water. It’s important to add the flour and water little by little like this, so that your batter does not have too much weight thrown on it and that you allow each amount of flour and water to completely mix into the batter. Stop to scrape down the bowl as needed. Add the remaining flour mixture, followed by the remaining hot water, and beat just until combined. Using a spatula, fold the grated apple into the batter. Take care not to overmix the batter. If you overmix the batter, the cupcakes will not be light and fluffy but instead very dense. Use a standard-size ice-cream scoop to fill each baking cup with batter, so the cups are two-thirds full. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes (start checking at 15 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. After 5 minutes, transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely for approximately 20 minutes. It’s always best to cool the cupcakes at room temperature. Putting them in the refrigerator to cool can dry out the cake. Place all ingredients in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment; beat until well combined. Be sure to beat on high speed at the very end for at least 2 minutes to ensure that the frosting is light and fluffy. Pour the sugar and water into a large saucepan. Heat on medium-high heat and stir constantly until the sugar completely liquefies. Stir constantly and be careful not to burn the sugar. After all the sugar has dissolved, add the butter and vanilla extract to the saucepan and mix thoroughly. Once the butter has melted and the butter and sugar are completely mixed, remove from heat and, using a whisk, slowly whisk in the heavy cream until you reach a beautiful golden brown caramel color. Set aside and let cool and thicken for 5 minutes at room temperature. Refrigerate for 20 minutes to thicken further before you use to fill or decorate.

Whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Combine the buttermilk and vanilla in a medium bowl or a 2-cup liquid measuring cup. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl, if using a handheld mixer), cream the 1 cup of butter and the brown sugar on low speed until creamy and well combined. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and airy, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium-low and add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition and scraping down the side and bottom of the bowl as needed. Once all 3 eggs are added, beat for 1 minute on medium speed to get the mixture nice and fluffy. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk mixture in three batches, starting with the flour. Add the melted chocolate and mix on medium speed until well incorporated, stopping the mixer to scrape down the side and bottom of the bowl as needed. Use a rubber or offset spatula to scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even it out as much as possible. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean and the center of the cake resists light pressure, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely, at least 2 hours, before frosting. Make the frosting: Put the butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a medium bowl, if using a handheld mixer). Beat on medium-high speed until smooth. Turn off the mixer and sift the confectioners’ sugar into the bowl and combine on low speed. Add the melted chocolate, soy sauce, and vanilla and beat on low speed until combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium-low and whip until glossy, 15 to 30 seconds. Use an offset spatula or butter knife to spread the frosting on top of the cooled cake. Cut into squares and serve. DO AHEAD: The cake will keep, loosely covered with plastic wrap in the refrigerator, for up to 3 days. Let it sit out at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing and serving.

Recipe: Chocolatey Chocolate Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 12 ingredients, 17 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 3/4 cups (225g) all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup (45g) unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar, 2 eggs, at room temperature, 1 cup (240ml) whole milk, 1/2 cup (120ml) grapeseed oil or any mild-flavored oil, 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 1 cup (240ml) boiling water, Confectioners' sugar, chocolate Swiss meringue buttercream, warm ganache, marshmallow icing, whipped cream

Cooking instructions:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 10 by 3-inch round pan with butter, line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper, and grease the paper. (I’ll let you just grease, line the bottom of the pan, and lightly flour the sides if you’re feeling lazy.) Place a large sifter or a sieve in a large mixing bowl. Add the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and sift. Add the sugar and whisk until combined. In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla together. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until there are no lumps and the batter is smooth. Carefully pour in the boiling water and stir until combined. (Watch the little ones with the hot water!) Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the center of the oven for approximately 50 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, and the cake bounces back when lightly pressed. Remove from the oven and let the cake stand for 10 minutes. Run a butter knife around the cake to gently release. Peel off the parchment paper from the sides. Invert the cake, peel off the bottom piece of parchment, and cool on a wire rack. Coffee Enhanced Chocolate Cake: Swap the cup of water for a cup of hot black coffee.

Recipe: East 62nd Street Lemon Cake
Category: cake
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 22 steps

Ingredients needed:
3 cups sifted unbleached all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, 2 cups sugar, 4 large eggs, 1 cup milk, Finely grated zest of 2 large lemons, 1/3 cup lemon juice, 2/3 cup sugar

Cooking instructions:
Adjust an oven rack one-third up from the bottom of oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a plain or fancy tube pan with an 11- to 12-cup capacity and dust it lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat the butter to soften it a bit. Add the sugar and beat for 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs individually, scraping the bowl as necessary with a rubber spatula to keep mixture smooth. On lowest speed, alternately add the dry ingredients in three additions and the milk in two additions, scraping the bowl with the rubber spatula as necessary and beating only until incorporated after each addition. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Stir in lemon zest. Turn the batter into prepared pan. Level top by rotating pan briskly back and forth. Bake for 1 hour and 5 to 10 minutes, until a cake tester comes out dry. Let cake stand in the pan for about 5 minutes and then cover with a rack and invert. Place over a large piece of aluminum foil or wax paper. The glaze should be used immediately after it is mixed: Stir the lemon juice and sugar together and brush all over the hot cake until absorbed. Let cake cool completely. Use two wide metal pancake turners or a cookie sheet to transfer it to a cake plate. Do not cut for at least several hours. I have made this with 1/2 cup Key lime juice in the glaze in place of the 1/3 cup lemon juice and it is divine. (But you should continue to use the lemon zest in the cake itself.)

3/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, 6 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 4 tsp. baking powder, 4 tsp. kosher salt, 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda

Cooking instructions:
Place butter on a plate and freeze until very firm, about 15 minutes. Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a food processor until combined. Add frozen butter and pulse until mixture resembles sand and no visible clumps of butter remain, 1–2 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Do Ahead: Mix can be made 1 month ahead. Keep chilled. To make a batch of 4 pancakes, whisk 1 cup mix, 1 large egg, and 1/2 cup milk or 3/4 cup buttermilk in a medium bowl to combine. Heat a griddle or large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium; brush with butter. Drop batter by 1/4-cupfuls onto griddle. Cook pancakes until bubbles form on the surface and pop and the underside is golden brown, 2–3 minutes. Turn and cook until lightly browned on the other side, 1–2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing griddle with butter as needed. To make a batch of 4 small or 2 large waffles, separate 2 large eggs. Whisk egg yolks, 2 cups mix, and 1/2 cup milk or 3/4 cup buttermilk in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat egg whites in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Gently fold into batter. Heat a waffle iron until very hot; brush with butter. Working in batches and brushing iron with more butter as needed, pour batter onto iron (it should cover the entire surface; the amount of batter will vary according to manufacturer). Cook waffles until golden brown and cooked through, 3–7 minutes, depending on waffle iron. To make a batch of 4 crepes, whisk 2 eggs, 1 cup mix, and 1 cup milk in a medium bowl to combine. Heat a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high, then brush with butter. Ladle about 1/4 cup batter into skillet and swirl to evenly coat bottom. Cook crepe until bubbles form on the surface and edges are golden and crisp, about 3 minutes. Slide a spatula underneath crepe to loosen and carefully turn. Cook until a few brown spots appear, about 15 seconds. Transfer to a plate. Tent with foil to keep warm while you cook remaining crepes.
