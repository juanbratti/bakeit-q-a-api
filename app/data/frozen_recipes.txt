Recipe: No-Churn Almond and Raspberry Swirl Ice Cream
Category: frozen
Complexity: 6 ingredients, 21 steps

Ingredients needed:
3 cups (600 g) fresh raspberries, 2 Tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. kosher salt, divided, 1 (14-oz.) can sweetened condensed milk, 1 tsp. almond extract, 2 cups heavy cream

Cooking instructions:
Bring raspberries, sugar, and ¼ tsp. salt to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring often, until raspberries begin to burst and lose their shape, about 4 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring glass, pressing on solids; discard solids. Pour back into saucepan and return to medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thick enough to coat a spoon, 10–15 minutes. (You should have about 6 Tbsp.) Transfer back to measuring glass and chill until cold, about 30 minutes. Mix condensed milk, almond extract, and remaining ¾ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine. Using an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add a dollop of whipped cream to condensed milk mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage—folding—is easier). Add remaining whipped cream; fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of condensed milk mixture remain. Scrape about one third of ice cream base into a loaf pan that’s at least 8½x4½". Drizzle over one third of raspberry syrup. Repeat layers 2 more times, ending with raspberry syrup (no need to be precise). Using a small offset spatula or butter knife, make figure-eight motions through ice cream base to swirl raspberry syrup throughout. Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours. To serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls. Do Ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.

Recipe: No-Churn Fresh Mint and Chocolate Ice Cream
Category: frozen
Complexity: 6 ingredients, 22 steps

Ingredients needed:
¾ cup (15 g) coarsely chopped mint, 2 cups (or more) heavy cream, divided, 4 oz. bittersweet chocolate (65%–75% cacao), coarsely chopped, 1 (14-oz.) can sweetened condensed milk, 1 tsp. kosher salt, ½ cup (40 g) Dutch-process cocoa powder

Cooking instructions:
Bring mint and 1 cup cream to a bare simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit 30 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a measuring glass, pressing on solids; discard solids. Chill cream until very cold, about 30 minutes. Just before cream is ready, heat chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (do not let bowl touch water), stirring occasionally, until melted and smooth. (Alternatively, heat in 20-second increments in a microwave, stirring between bursts.) Mix together sweetened condensed milk and salt in a medium bowl. Pour remaining 1 cup cream into infused cream in measuring glass. (You should have 2 cups; add more if needed.) Transfer to a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat cream, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add a dollop of whipped cream to condensed milk mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage—folding—is easier). Add remaining whipped cream, then sift in cocoa powder. Fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of condensed milk mixture remain and cocoa powder is combined. Scrape about one quarter of ice cream base into a loaf pan that’s at least 8½x4½". Using a fork, drizzle about one third of melted chocolate over. Repeat layering process, finishing with a layer of ice cream base, to create 4 layers of ice cream base total and 3 layers of drizzled chocolate. Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours. To serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls. Do Ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.

Recipe: No-Churn Labneh and Lime Ice Cream With Granola
Category: frozen
Complexity: 7 ingredients, 14 steps

Ingredients needed:
½ cup labneh (Lebanese strained yogurt) or 1 cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt, ¾ cup (75 g) granola, 1 (14-oz.) can sweetened condensed milk, Zest and juice of 2 limes, ¾ tsp. kosher salt, 1½ cups heavy cream, Special Equipment: 2 layers of cheesecloth

Cooking instructions:
If using Greek yogurt, set a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl; line with cheesecloth. Place yogurt in sieve and let drain in refrigerator 4 hours (you should have ½ cup); discard drained liquid in bowl. Pulse granola in a food processor to break up a bit. (Or roll up in a kitchen towel and gently crush with a rolling pin.) Whisk labneh (or strained yogurt), condensed milk, lime zest and juice, and salt in a medium bowl until smooth. Using an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl, starting on low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high as it thickens, until billowy and stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. Add a dollop of whipped cream to labneh mixture and mix in with a rubber spatula (this is just to lighten it so that the next stage—folding—is easier). Add remaining whipped cream and fold in, running spatula down sides and along bottom of bowl, then lifting up through center and over top while rotating bowl to integrate without deflating, until very few streaks of labneh mixture remain. Fold in granola; scrape ice cream base into a loaf pan that’s at least 8½x4½". Cover with plastic wrap or an airtight silicone lid and freeze until solid, at least 8 hours. To serve, transfer loaf pan to refrigerator and let ice cream soften 10 minutes before scooping into bowls. Do Ahead: Ice cream can be made 1 week ahead. Keep frozen.

Recipe: Strawberry Honey Balsamic With Black Pepper Ice Cream
Category: frozen
Complexity: 14 ingredients, 28 steps

Ingredients needed:
10 ounces (about 1 pint) ripe strawberries, hulled and halved, ¼ cup honey, Heat the oven to 300°F. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper., ½ cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons dry milk powder, ¼ teaspoon xanthan gum, 2 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1⅓ cups whole milk, 1⅓ cups heavy cream, ¾ cup Strawberry Puree (recipe follows), very cold, ¼ cup honey balsamic vinegar, like Honey Ridge Farms or O Olive Oil, ⅛ teaspoon freshly (and very finely) ground black pepper, 3 cups Ice Cream Base (recipe follows), very cold, ¾ cup your favorite strawberry jam

Cooking instructions:
Spread the strawberries out evenly on the lined sheet pan and drizzle them with the honey. Bake for 15 minutes. Stir the berries and continue baking until they just barely begin to caramelize and get a little bit of roasted color to them, about 20 minutes more. Remove the sheet pan from the oven and let them sit until they’re cool enough to handle. Transfer the berries to a blender along with the yummy sticky stuff on the parchment paper and puree to make a smooth sauce. Chill in the fridge until cold. Store the puree in the fridge for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Combine the sugar, dry milk, and xanthan gum in a small bowl and stir well. Pour the corn syrup into a medium pot and stir in the whole milk. Add the sugar mixture and immediately whisk vigorously until smooth. Set the pot over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Add the cream and whisk until fully combined. Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 6 hours, or for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours. Stir the base back together if it separates during the resting time. The base can be further stored in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. (Just be sure to fully thaw the frozen base before using it.) In a bowl, combine the strawberry puree, vinegar, and black pepper with the ice cream base. Whisk as needed to get everything completely incorporated into the base. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until it has the texture of soft-serve. Stir the jam with a fork to loosen it. Quickly alternate spooning layers of the mixture and dollops of the jam in freezer-friendly containers. Cover with parchment paper, pressing it to the surface of the ice cream so it adheres, then cover with a lid. It’s okay if the parchment hangs over the rim. Store it in the coldest part of your freezer (farthest from the door) until firm, at least 6 hours. It will keep for up to 3 months.

Recipe: White Peach and Bourbon Vanilla Ice-Cream
Category: frozen
Complexity: 10 ingredients, 24 steps

Ingredients needed:
1 quart water, 1 1/2 cups (330g) caster (superfine) sugar, 8 medium white peaches (1.2kg), 2 cups (500ml) milk, 1 cup (250ml) half-and-half, 1 teaspoon vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract, 8 egg yolks, 2/3 cup (150g) caster (superfine) sugar, extra, 1/4 cup (60ml) bourbon, 18 store-bought amaretti cookies (65g), crushed to serve

Cooking instructions:
Place the water and sugar in a large saucepan over high heat, bring to the boil and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the peaches, cover with a round of non-stick baking paper and weigh down with a small plate to submerge. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15–20 minutes or until soft. Drain the peaches, reserving the syrup. Allow to cool slightly before peeling. Refrigerate half the peaches for 1–2 hours or until cold. Cut the remaining peaches in half, discarding the stones, and place in a food processor. Process until smooth and refrigerate until cold. Place the milk, cream and vanilla in a medium saucepan over high heat and stir until just boiling. Remove from the heat and set aside. Place the egg yolks and extra sugar in a large bowl and whisk until well combined. Gradually pour the milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking to combine. Return the mixture to the saucepan over low heat and cook, stirring, for 8 minutes or until the custard is thick and coats the back of a spoon. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1–2 hours or until cold. Add the bourbon and the peach puree to the custard and whisk to combine. Pour into a metal (not glass) brownie pan. Freeze for 8 hours or overnight until set. Cut the ice-cream into squares. In batches, place the squares in the cleaned food processor and process until smooth. Return the mixture to the tin and freeze for 1 hour or until firm. Scoop the ice-cream into serving bowls. Drizzle with the reserved peach syrup and sprinkle with the amaretti. Serve with the whole poached peaches.
